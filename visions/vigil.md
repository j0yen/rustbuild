Created: 2026-05-28
Seed: reflection — run-18 self-review (2026-05-28 ~20:02 PDT) re-opened
  the "agorabus daemon stale binary" item the **same day** it had been
  resolved at runs 16–17. Caught live during this dream's Phase 1: pid
  2138939 still exec'ing `/home/jsy/.local/bin/agorabus (deleted)`.
Pace: opt-in (default — drafts ship to /build per 2026-05-27 instruction).

## TL;DR

`freshness` catches stale *memory bodies*. `drift` catches stale
*skill text*. Neither catches the third axis: a **running process
executing a binary that no longer matches its source**. That axis bit
the laptop repeatedly. Run-18 journal (verbatim):

> agorabus daemon stale binary — RE-OPENED. commit `02350fb` /
> `cf98f2d` (v0.4.0 multi-prefix-subscribe) landed 19:56, running
> daemon pid 2138939 built 14:55 = pre-fix. Escalated, not
> auto-restarted.

It is *still* stale during this Phase 1: `/proc/2138939/exe` resolves to
`/home/jsy/.local/bin/agorabus (deleted)` — the 20:52 reinstall unlinked
the inode the daemon is running from. The kernel hands us a crisp
staleness flag (`(deleted)` suffix) and provfs hands us a second one
(`user.prov.ts` on the on-disk binary, observed `1780026726` =
2026-05-28 20:52). Yet nothing on the laptop reads either. Every
self-review hand-writes the same finding and parks it.

Vigil builds the missing layer:

1. A **read-only detector** (`binstale`) that classifies, per running
   PID or per fleet glob, whether the executing binary is stale —
   using the kernel's `(deleted)` signal, inode drift, and provfs
   timestamps — and compares against the source repo's HEAD.
2. A **safe rolling-restart orchestrator** (`rollout`) that consumes
   the detector's verdict and brings stale daemons current one at a
   time, with a window guard so it never kills a voice daemon
   mid-conversation.
3. **Integration** so self-review surfaces stale daemons structurally
   (not a hand-written journal note every tick) and so agorabus can
   answer "am I current?" about its own running process.

This is the sibling of `freshness` (memory drift) and `drift` (skill
drift): same evidence-rich, proposal-first, never-silently-mutate
ethos — but the action half (`rollout`) genuinely mutates the live
fleet, so it is a separate, opt-in, one-at-a-time, window-guarded tool
with `--dry-run` as the default posture.

## End-state

When vigil is fully built:

- `binstale scan` reports every long-lived wintermute daemon
  (`agorabus`, `recalld`, `wm-audio|dialog|stt|tts`, …) with a verdict:
  `fresh | deleted-exe | inode-drift | prov-stale | behind-head`, plus
  the evidence (exe path, inode pair, provfs ts, HEAD commit ts).
- The "stale binary" anomaly that self-review re-discovers by hand
  every tick is surfaced by a structured probe, with the exact
  `rollout` command pre-filled in Pending.
- `rollout apply` rebuilds → reinstalls → gracefully restarts → polls
  agorabus `peers` to confirm re-registration, **one daemon at a time**,
  refusing to touch a voice daemon while a dialog turn is in flight.
- `agorabus doctor` answers whether the running bus daemon is current
  with its installed binary — the daemon introspecting its own
  staleness rather than waiting for an external scan.
- The escalate-don't-auto-restart call (which paid off at run 16) stays
  a deliberate human choice — vigil makes that choice *one command*
  instead of a five-step hand-rolled rebuild/reinstall/kill/relaunch/push.

## Components

**Fleet 1 — five PRDs:**

1. **binstale** (`rust-cli`, new repo `~/wintermute/binstale/`) —
   foundational, read-only detector. `binstale check <pid>` and
   `binstale scan --match <regex>` classify a running process's exe as
   `fresh | deleted-exe | inode-drift | prov-stale`. Signals: the
   `(deleted)` suffix on `/proc/PID/exe`; inode mismatch between
   `/proc/PID/exe` and the resolved installed path; provfs
   `user.prov.ts` of the on-disk binary older than a reference. JSON +
   table output. No mutation.

2. **binstale-source-cmp** (`rust-extend` → `~/wintermute/binstale/`) —
   the `behind-head` verdict. Maps a daemon to its source repo, reads
   `git log -1 --format=%ct -- src/` for the newest commit touching
   source, and flags a running binary whose provenance/install ts
   predates that commit — even when the binary still exists on disk
   (the run-18 case exactly: binary built 14:55, fix committed 19:56).

3. **rollout** (`rust-cli`, new repo `~/wintermute/rollout/`) — the
   orchestrator. Consumes `binstale scan --format json`; for each stale
   daemon runs rebuild → install → graceful SIGTERM+relaunch → poll
   agorabus `peers` for re-registration, strictly serialized. `--dry-run`
   is the default; `apply` mutates. Per-daemon launch recipe lives in a
   config map.

4. **binstale-self-review** (`shell`, edits
   `~/.claude/skills/self-review/SKILL.md`) — wires `binstale scan` into
   self-review Phase B.5 so the recurring stale-binary item becomes a
   deterministic probe with the `rollout` command pre-filled in Pending,
   retiring the hand-written journal note.

5. **agorabus-doctor-selfstale** (`rust-extend` →
   `~/wintermute/agorabus/`) — `agorabus doctor` reports whether the
   running bus daemon is current with its installed binary, via the same
   `(deleted)`/inode/provfs signals applied to its own pid. Lets the bus
   answer "am I current?" without an external scan.

## Order

```
binstale  (read-only detector; ship first)
   ├──► binstale-source-cmp     (extends binstale: behind-head verdict)
   ├──► binstale-self-review    (wires binstale scan into self-review)
   └──► rollout                 (consumes binstale scan; mutates fleet)
agorabus-doctor-selfstale       (independent; agorabus self-introspection)
```

- `binstale-source-cmp` and `binstale-self-review` both extend/consume
  `binstale` — ship `binstale` first.
- `rollout` consumes `binstale scan` output; it can ship before
  `binstale-source-cmp` (it acts on `deleted-exe`/`inode-drift` alone)
  but is strictly better with the `behind-head` verdict in hand.
- `agorabus-doctor-selfstale` extends a *different* repo (agorabus) and
  has no dependency — it can ship any time, but coordinate with the live
  agorabus rollout (see gossip / open questions).

## Fleet 3 — the handover mechanism (drafted 2026-05-29)

Fleet 1 detects staleness and orchestrates a fleet-wide rolling restart
(`rollout`). It assumes a bus bounce is a *brief* drop. Phase 1 of the
2026-05-29 dream proved that assumption false (see Open Questions →
Restart vs reload). Fleet 3 makes a live agorabus bounce **non-
destructive**, so `rollout` (and self-review's auto-fix) can act on the
bus without stranding live sessions. These extend `~/wintermute/agorabus/`
except where noted; they compose under `rollout` (which can call
`agorabus reload` for the bus and fall back to SIGTERM+relaunch for
daemons that lack it).

1. **agorabus-client-reconnect** (`rust-extend` → `~/wintermute/agorabus/`,
   `src/client.rs`) — **the keystone.** The long-lived `subscribe` client
   detects EOF / `ECONNRESET`, then loops: reopen the socket with
   bounded exponential backoff + jitter, re-`announce`, re-`subscribe`
   to the same prefixes, and resume appending to the same inbox ndjson —
   without re-running the SessionStart hook. Makes any daemon bounce
   survivable for already-running sessions. Everything else in Fleet 3
   depends on this existing.

2. **agorabus-drain-notice** (`rust-extend` → `~/wintermute/agorabus/`,
   `src/daemon.rs` + `src/main.rs`) — graceful shutdown. On SIGTERM the
   daemon broadcasts `{"op":"bus.draining","resume_after_ms":N}` to all
   subscribers before closing the listener, so reconnect clients stagger
   their retry by a server-suggested delay (no thundering herd at
   rebind). Consumed by the reconnect loop from PRD 1.

3. **agorabus-state-persist** (`rust-extend` → `~/wintermute/agorabus/`,
   `src/daemon.rs`) — finishes the persistence `daemon.rs:72` defers
   ("claims … dropped on daemon restart per PRD-chord-claim §State
   persistence"). Journals the claims table (and sticky intents) to
   `~/.cache/agorabus/state.json` on mutation + on drain, rehydrates on
   start. Survives a bounce so chord-claim locks and intents are not
   silently dropped during a reload.

4. **agorabus-reload** (`rust-extend` → `~/wintermute/agorabus/`, new
   `Command::Reload` + `src/reload.rs`) — the *non-destructive* version
   of vigil's one-command bounce. Verifies a fresh binary exists (built
   ahead), records the pre-bounce peer count, sends the drain signal to
   the running daemon, waits for clean exit, execs the new daemon, waits
   for socket bind, then polls `peers` until the count recovers (via the
   PRD-1 reconnect path) within a timeout — emits a verdict. Depends on
   PRDs 1–3.

5. **agorabus-reload-self-review** (`shell` → edits
   `~/.claude/skills/self-review/SKILL.md` playbook
   `agorabus_daemon_stale_binary`) — once the bounce is non-destructive,
   the auto-fix can use `agorabus reload` and the ≤5-subscriber ceiling
   (`SKILL.md:259`) can be lifted to a higher bound (reconnect handles
   the disruption). Closes the 4+-run carried-forward escalation loop.
   Depends on PRD 4 shipping + verified.

**Order (Fleet 3):**

```
agorabus-client-reconnect   (keystone; ship first)
   ├──► agorabus-drain-notice    (reconnect consumes the drain delay)
   └──► agorabus-state-persist   (independent of drain; both extend agorabus — serialize commits)
agorabus-reload                  (depends on reconnect + drain + persist)
   └──► agorabus-reload-self-review  (depends on reload shipped + verified)
```

All four agorabus extends touch the same crate — **serialize** their
/build cycles (reconnect → drain → persist → reload) to avoid lib.rs /
Cargo churn rebases, same caution Fleet 1's gossip raised for the
companion fleet.

## Fleet 4 — close the loop at the install site (drafted 2026-05-30)

Fleet 1 *detects* staleness. Fleet 3 makes the *reaction* (a bounce)
non-destructive. Both are downstream of the fact that staleness keeps
*happening*. Three self-review runs on 2026-05-29 (runs 9, 10, 11)
named the upstream cause out loud — verbatim from the run-10 reflective
memory:

> RECURRING ROOT CAUSE: /build installs new agorabus binary **without
> restarting the daemon**; consider wiring `systemctl --user restart
> agorabus.service` into /build's agorabus-install path.

And `agorabus reload --build` (Fleet 3) self-heals *the bus* — but it is
agorabus-specific. The same decoupling bites every other daemon-backed
binary the laptop ships: `recalld`, `wm-audio|dialog|stt|tts`, `wmd`
all have a systemd-user unit pointing at an installed binary
(`%h/.local/bin/...` or `%h/.cargo/bin/...`) and **none has a `reload`
subcommand**. When /build reinstalls a fresh `recalld`, nothing restarts
`recalld.service` — and recalld liveness is safety-critical. The bus
got a bespoke fix; the rest of the fleet did not.

The second gap is in the *reaction* path's safety. Run-11's reflective
memory (verbatim):

> PLAYBOOK GAP — `agorabus_daemon_stale_binary` auto-fix conditions
> don't check whether /build is concurrently building the same crate;
> that concurrent-build race is the real reason to defer, not the
> subscriber ceiling.

Run 11 deferred the auto-fix *by hand* because a live /build tick was
mid-rebuild of agorabus; a self-review rebuild/install/restart would
have raced /build on the same daemon + socket. The playbook's
"Auto-fix conditions (ALL must hold)" list
(`self-review/SKILL.md:262-272`) has no such guard — next time the
human isn't watching, the two will collide.

Fleet 4 closes both: make install *imply* restart for the whole fleet,
and make the reaction path refuse to act while /build is building the
same crate.

1. **vigil-install-restart** (`rust-extend` → `~/wintermute/rollout/`,
   new `Command::Install` + reverse unit-map) — `rollout install
   <binary> --dest <path>`: atomically install a freshly-built binary,
   then look up which live systemd-user unit `ExecStart`s that dest
   (reverse of the `ExecStart=`→binary map: agorabus, recalld, wmd,
   wm-audio|dialog|stt|tts) and restart it through the *best available*
   path — `agorabus reload --build` for the bus (non-destructive, Fleet
   3), window-guarded `systemctl --user restart` for the rest. Emits a
   verdict (`{installed, unit, restart_path, verdict}`). If the dest
   backs no unit, it's a plain install. Generalizes the bus's bespoke
   self-heal to the whole fleet. Depends on `rollout` (Fleet 1) +
   `agorabus reload` (Fleet 3) shipping.

2. **vigil-build-restart-wiring** (`shell` → /build's binary-install
   step) — route every daemon-backed `rust-extend` ship through
   `rollout install` so a fresh binary never strands a stale daemon.
   The convention: if a PRD's `build_into` resolves to a binary that an
   active systemd-user unit `ExecStart`s, /build's install must restart
   that unit (via `rollout install`), not just `install -m755` and walk
   away. This is the prevention-at-source fix the three run-9/10/11
   memories asked for. Depends on PRD 1.

3. **vigil-selfreview-concurrent-guard** (`shell` → edits
   `~/.claude/skills/self-review/SKILL.md` playbook
   `agorabus_daemon_stale_binary`) — add a concurrent-build guard to the
   "Auto-fix conditions": if `systemctl --user is-active
   claude-build-work.service` is `active` (the detached /build tick unit,
   30-min cap) — or the agorabus repo's `.git/index.lock` exists — defer
   the auto-fix and write Pending with reason "concurrent /build tick may
   be rebuilding agorabus; a self-review reload would race it on the same
   daemon + socket." Codifies run-11's hand-made deferral. Independent of
   PRDs 1–2, but **serialize on SKILL.md** with the Fleet-3
   `agorabus-reload-self-review` PRD (both edit the same playbook block).

**Order (Fleet 4):**

```
vigil-install-restart            (rust-extend rollout; needs rollout + agorabus-reload shipped)
   └──► vigil-build-restart-wiring   (shell; routes /build install through `rollout install`)
vigil-selfreview-concurrent-guard    (shell; independent — serialize on SKILL.md with reload-self-review)
```

## Fleet 2 (not drafted — honest deferrals per dream rule 6)

- **rollout-window-guard** — refuse/defer restart of a voice daemon
  (`wm-dialog|stt|tts`) while a dialog turn is in flight. Depends on a
  reliable "turn in progress" signal, which the
  *continuity-of-conversation* vision (`wmd-session-boundary`,
  `wm.brain.session.{start,end}`) is about to mint. Draft once that
  session-boundary event exists; until then `rollout` uses a coarse
  `--window` time guard only. Cross-vision dependency, not yet real.
- **binstale-watch** — a `pevent`-supervised daemon that scans on
  source-commit / install events (inotify on `~/.local/bin/` +
  repo `.git/`) and emits `wm.fleet.stale` on agorabus, so rollout can
  be event-driven rather than polled. Draft after `binstale` proves the
  verdict taxonomy is stable.
- **rollout-receipt** — autobuilder-style receipts per rolled daemon
  (pre/post pid, binary provenance ts, peer-count delta, elapsed) so a
  rollout is auditable. Draft after the first real `rollout apply`.

## Fleet 5 — the last mile: actually drive rollout against the live systemd fleet (drafted 2026-06-13)

Fleet 1 built the detector (`binstale`) and the orchestrator (`rollout`).
Fleet 4 made *install imply restart* (`rollout install`, systemd-aware).
Yet `fleet-binary-staleness` has stayed **open for run after run** —
wm-audio/dialog/tts/stt behind-head on 2026-06-11/12/13. The reason is
not detection and not safety; it is that **the orchestrator half is
inert**. Caught live this pass:

1. **`rollout` refuses every daemon because `fleet.toml` was never
   authored.** `rollout plan --only wm-audio` →
   `fleet.toml error: cannot read ~/.config/rollout/fleet.toml`
   (`find ~/.config -name fleet.toml*` is empty). This is vision Open
   Question #1 — "discuss the canonical launch path per daemon before
   `rollout apply` runs" — never resolved, so the config never got
   written, so the tool sits unusable.

2. **`rollout apply` uses the wrong restart model for this fleet.**
   `restart.rs` does build → `install_cmd` → SIGTERM old pid →
   `launch_cmd` → healthcheck — designed for hand-launched daemons
   (`launch_cmd = "agorabus serve &"`). But the live fleet is
   **systemd-managed**: `wm-audio|dialog|stt|tts.service` all
   `ExecStart=%h/{.cargo,.local}/bin/wm-… start`, with `Restart=always`
   drop-ins ([[self_agorabus_restart_kills_voice]]). A manual SIGTERM
   *races systemd's own restart*, and `launch_cmd` spawns a daemon
   systemd doesn't track. Meanwhile `rollout install` (Fleet 4)
   **already** has the correct systemd path (`install.rs`: reverse
   unit-map + `systemctl --user restart <unit>`) — the `apply` path just
   never learned it.

3. **The precise window guard is finally buildable.** Fleet 2 deferred
   `rollout-window-guard` because it needed "a reliable turn-in-progress
   signal" from continuity-of-conversation. That signal now exists:
   `wm.dialog.turn.{user,system}` and `wm.brain.session.{start,end}` are
   live event names in `wintermute-dialog`/`wintermute-brain` source.
   `health.rs` still uses only a coarse `--window` time sample. (It also
   excludes `wm-audio` from `VOICE_SET_PATTERN` — but wm-audio is the
   mic pipeline; restarting it drops input mid-turn too.)

Fleet 5 closes the last mile so the recurring escalation finally has a
one-command, window-guarded, systemd-correct cure.

1. **rollout-fleet-gen** (`rust-extend` → `~/wintermute/rollout/`) — a
   `rollout fleet-gen` subcommand that *derives* a candidate `fleet.toml`
   from live state (binstale scan × `~/.config/systemd/user/*.service`
   ExecStart map), writes `fleet.toml.proposed` + a diff, never the live
   file. Resolves Open Q#1 with a tool instead of a hand-edit. Foundation
   — without a fleet.toml, `apply` can't run.

2. **rollout-apply-systemd** (`rust-extend` → `~/wintermute/rollout/`) —
   teach the `apply`/`restart.rs` path to honour a recipe that names a
   systemd unit and restart via the same `systemctl --user restart` logic
   `install.rs` already owns, instead of SIGTERM+launch. Serialize its
   /build cycle with PRD 3 (both touch the rollout crate).

3. **rollout-window-guard-turnaware** (`rust-extend` →
   `~/wintermute/rollout/`) — replace the coarse `--window` sample with a
   precise guard that subscribes to `wm.dialog.turn.*` /
   `wm.brain.session.*` and refuses to restart a voice daemon (extend the
   set to include `wm-audio`) while a turn/session is in flight. This is
   Fleet 2's deferred `rollout-window-guard`, now unblocked.

4. **rollout-selfreview-apply** (`shell` → self-review `SKILL.md`) — once
   1–3 land, change the `fleet-binary-staleness` Pending pre-fill from
   `rollout plan --only <d>` to the window-guarded
   `rollout apply --only <d> --window` — **still human-run, never
   autonomous**. Note: SKILL.md:830 calls the escalate-don't-apply
   guardrail "immutable"; this PRD changes only *which command is
   suggested for the human to run*, not who runs it — but it needs Joe's
   explicit nod (see Open Questions).

**Order (Fleet 5):**

```
rollout-fleet-gen                  (foundation; authors the missing config)
   └──► rollout-apply-systemd      (apply honours systemd units)
        └──► rollout-window-guard-turnaware  (serialize w/ apply-systemd on the crate)
             └──► rollout-selfreview-apply    (shell; needs 1–3 shipped + verified)
```

## Open questions

- **Lifting the "immutable" self-review guardrail (Fleet 5 PRD 4).**
  `SKILL.md:830` declares "self-review never runs `rollout apply`
  autonomously … this guardrail is immutable." Fleet 5 PRD 4 keeps
  *autonomous* application forbidden but changes the pre-filled command a
  human runs from `rollout plan` to a window-guarded `rollout apply`.
  This is a deliberate posture change to a block the SKILL marks
  immutable — **needs Joe's explicit approval before /build ships it.**
- **Per-daemon launch recipe**: `rollout` must know how each daemon is
  (re)launched. `pevent list` is empty (the bus daemon is *not*
  pevent-supervised), and `install.sh` uses `cargo install --path .`
  (→ `~/.cargo/bin`) while the running binary is at `~/.local/bin/agorabus`
  (provfs `comm:install` stamp) — two install paths. Fleet 1 `rollout`
  reads launch recipes from a config file the user authors; deriving
  them automatically (from systemd units / hook scripts / the
  SessionStart handshake) is deferred. **Discuss the canonical launch
  path per daemon before `rollout apply` runs against the live fleet.**
- **Who owns the live agorabus rollout right now?** Run-18 escalated
  pid 2138939 deliberately ("a live /build session likely owns the
  rollout"). `agorabus-doctor-selfstale` and any `rollout` test must not
  collide with that in-flight human/skill-owned rollout. Coordinate via
  gossip.
- **Restart vs reload** — **RESOLVED 2026-05-29 → see Fleet 3.** The
  Fleet 1 assumption ("brief peer-drop acceptable; the SessionStart
  handshake re-attaches peers") is **false for live sessions.** Phase 1
  of the 2026-05-29 dream pass read `agorabus/src/client.rs` and found
  the long-lived `subscribe` client has **no reconnect logic** — when
  the daemon dies, the subscriber process dies with it. The SessionStart
  hook (`agorabus-session-start.sh`) is the *only* re-registration path
  and it fires only at session *start*, never on daemon death. So a live
  bounce permanently strands every current session's subscriber until
  that session restarts. This is the root cause of the carried-forward
  stale-binary debt: self-review's `agorabus_daemon_stale_binary`
  playbook escalates rather than auto-fixes whenever subscribers > 5
  (`SKILL.md:259`), because the bounce is genuinely destructive
  (`SKILL.md:270`: "other live Claude sessions will need to re-run their
  SessionStart hook … a user-visible disruption"). Fleet 3 builds the
  handover *mechanism* so the bounce is non-destructive — which is what
  finally lets the auto-fix run within guardrails.
- **provfs reliability for binaries**: the `(deleted)` signal is
  kernel-truth and needs no provfs. The `prov-stale` verdict relies on
  `user.prov.ts` being stamped on install — verified present on
  `~/.local/bin/agorabus` (`1780026726`), but a `cargo install` to
  `~/.cargo/bin` may not pass through the same `install(1)` codepath that
  triggers provfs's close-after-write stamp. `binstale` must degrade
  gracefully (fall back to mtime) when the xattr is absent.
