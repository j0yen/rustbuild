# dream ↔ build gossip

Append-only shared notebook between `/dream` and `/build`.

Format: one section per entry, fenced with `## <ISO-ts>  /<skill>  <subject>`.
Body is free-form markdown — order hints, blockers, questions, observations,
links between PRDs. Never rewrite earlier entries; correct by appending a
new entry that references the older one.

Read the tail before acting. Append after acting.

## 2026-05-24T18:50  /dream  bootstrap
Channel opened. `/dream` skill created at `~/.claude/skills/dream/`. First
real entries will follow when the user invokes `/dream <topic>`.

## 2026-05-24T19:30  /dream  vision-wintermute
Drafted: PRD-wintermute-bootstrap.md, PRD-wintermute-platform.md,
  PRD-wintermute-audio.md, PRD-wintermute-stt.md, PRD-wintermute-tts.md,
  PRD-wintermute-dialog.md, PRD-wintermute-brain.md (7 PRDs, Fleet 1).
Vision: visions/wintermute.md (voice-first AI laptop for a
  computer-illiterate user; prototyping on this laptop under the
  wintermute name; she will name her own laptop later).

**User override — ATTENTION /build:** all 7 PRDs carry `build_auto: true`.
  Default `/dream` rule is `build_auto: false`; user explicitly
  authorized aggressive pace this session. Treat as opt-in even though
  the flag is set — the user wants you to start ticking immediately.

**Sequencing for /build:**
  - PRD-wintermute-bootstrap and PRD-wintermute-platform are entry
    gates (no upstream deps). Either can start first.
  - PRD-wintermute-audio gates wm-stt, wm-dialog, and the barge-in
    cancel path for wm-tts.
  - PRD-wintermute-tts can land in parallel with audio (only needs
    a sink); useful early so platform's greeting works on first boot.
  - PRD-wintermute-dialog and PRD-wintermute-brain develop in parallel;
    brain has a real dependency on PRD-recall-daemon.md shipping
    (recall daemon mode for sub-10ms PostToolUse retrieval).
  - Recommended order: bootstrap → platform → audio + tts (parallel) →
    stt → dialog → brain.

**Cross-PRD collaboration to coordinate:**
  - PRD-wintermute-tts and `peon-ping/docs/prds/PRD-003-tts-spoken-feedback.md`
    both want a Linux TTS engine. Contract documented in wm-tts §2.5:
    whoever ships first defines the `wm-voicepack` resolver crate; the
    other adopts it. Don't double-build the Piper backend.
  - PRD-wintermute-brain depends on PRD-recall-daemon.md (sub-10ms
    retrieval path). If recall-daemon isn't live when brain implementation
    starts, brain falls back to in-process recall (loud warning; 500ms
    instead of 10ms — functional but degraded).

**Plan-agent's flagged risks** (worth surfacing during /build iterations):
  - **AEC3 build flag on Arch's `pipewire` package** — `wm-audio` detects
    at startup and falls back to webrtc classic; PRD documents the
    rebuild path if AEC3 is missing.
  - **microWakeWord pretrained-only in v1** — custom wake-word training
    is too finicky for a non-literate user's setup. Wake word is
    selected from a pretrained set ("Hey Jarvis" / "Okay Nabu" /
    "Hey Mycroft") during bootstrap. Do NOT promise "Hey Wintermute"
    custom training; that's Fleet 3 if it ever happens.
  - **Sonnet vs Opus default for brain** — Sonnet 4.6 by default; Opus
    4.7 opt-in via `wmd --model opus` for the next turn only. Opus on
    every chatty turn would burn cost and latency.

**Open question for /build:**
  - PRD-wintermute-platform §2.3 leaves the supervisor choice open:
    reuse `pevent` (Option A, recommended) or hand-roll standalone
    (Option B). Pick during platform's iter-1; document the call in
    the platform repo's README. Leaning A — `pevent` is already
    battle-tested on this laptop and the dep is local.

**Library picks summary** (full table in visions/wintermute.md):
  microWakeWord (wake) · Silero VAD · whisper.cpp + whisper-rs (STT,
  distil-small.en default) · Piper (TTS) · PipeWire module-echo-cancel
  (AEC) · NoiseTorch-ng (NS) · Claude API Sonnet 4.6 (brain).
  Reference architecture: Home Assistant Voice PE pipeline at
  300-700ms end-to-end on a Pi5 — proves the latency budget.

**Fleet 2 and Fleet 3** are captured as bullets in visions/wintermute.md
  but NOT drafted as PRD files in this pass. User will invoke
  `/dream extend wintermute` after Fleet 1 has shipped enough to
  learn from (≥3 of 7 components). Examples in vision doc:
  wintermute-browser, wintermute-desktop, wintermute-mail,
  wintermute-music, wintermute-screen-narrate, wintermute-emergency,
  wintermute-voice-profile, wintermute-glow (state indicator —
  dropped from Fleet 1 because non-blocking for first-usable).

**Notes for next /dream tick:**
  - When /build ships #1 bootstrap and #2 platform, /dream should
    consider drafting wintermute-glow (visual state indicator) so the
    caregiver / her sighted helpers have an at-a-glance view of what
    the laptop is doing.
  - Worth a /dream pass on `wintermute-offline-persona` once the brain
    is up — the offline behavior in v1 is a polite apology; richer
    offline (cached news, music, time-telling, small local LLM chat)
    is a vision in its own right.

## 2026-05-25T04:30  /dream  vision-continuity
Drafted: PRD-agentns-claude.md, PRD-provq.md, PRD-memlog-witness.md,
  PRD-recall-session-stamp.md, PRD-session-postmortem.md (5 PRDs,
  Fleet 1). Vision: visions/continuity.md (kernel→userspace bridge —
  consume memlog + provfs LSM + agent namespaces from userspace so
  every Claude session has a primary-source 128-bit id and downstream
  tools can attribute work to it).

**Default rule applied — ATTENTION /build:** all 5 PRDs carry
  `build_auto: false`. Unlike the wintermute fleet, this one is opt-in
  per PRD — the user reviews each before /build advances it. Don't tick
  these until the user flips the flag or explicitly authorizes.

**Sequencing for /build (once authorized):**
  - PRD-agentns-claude is the entry gate (every other PRD benefits
    from a stable session_id at session start, and #4 + #5 require it
    in non-mock mode).
  - PRD-provq and PRD-memlog-witness are independent of #1 and of each
    other — develop in parallel. Both can scaffold pre-boot; their live
    ACs gate on `linux-wintermute` being booted.
  - PRD-recall-session-stamp depends on #1's session_id resolution
    contract. Target version: recall v0.6.0 (intentional gap above the
    in-flight v0.5.x band held by recall-daemon and rebased
    recall-outcome-feedback).
  - PRD-session-postmortem depends on all four. Can scaffold against
    fixtures pre-#1–#4 ship; AC9 gates on all four shipping.

**Boot gating (important):**
  - The wintermute kernel package is BUILT (per 2026-05-24 changelog)
    but AWAITS BOOT VALIDATION. Until the user boots into
    `linux-wintermute`, all `[boot]`-marked ACs cannot pass. Mock
    interface contracts are documented in each PRD (AGENTNS_SESSION_ID
    env override, `/tmp/agentns-mock` file, fixture replay for
    memlog-witness).
  - /build should NOT mark these PRDs verified-completed before boot
    validation lands, even if mechanical ACs pass. Annotate manifest
    entries with `boot_validation_pending: true` until then.

**Cross-PRD coordination with in-flight work:**
  - recall-session-stamp targets v0.6.0 to avoid colliding with
    recall-daemon's v0.5.0 and recall-outcome-feedback's v0.5.1–0.5.3
    rebased band. v0.6.0 is past both; safe.
  - memlog-witness is a `rust-extend` to ~/wintermute/memlog/ — adds a
    new binary and a `persistence.rs` module. The existing kernel
    module, `libmemlog`, and `cli/memlog` (python show tool) are
    untouched.
  - session-postmortem composes by shelling out — does not re-implement
    ctrace parsing, recall queries, or xattr reads. Reduces blast
    radius if any of #1–#4 change their CLI surface; the postmortem
    just sees stdout.

**Notes for next /dream tick:**
  - Fleet 2 (vision continuity §"Fleet 2 — Hook into introspection")
    is bullets only: mirror-kernel, episode-from-memlog,
    letter-from-snapshot, /postmortem skill, agentns-budget-policy.
    Draft after ≥3 of 5 Fleet 1 PRDs ship.
  - Still pending from earlier /dream notes: wintermute-glow once
    bootstrap+platform ship; wintermute-offline-persona once brain is
    up. Not yet ready.

**Open question for /build:**
  - When /build encounters a PRD with `build_auto: false`, behavior is
    "skip until explicit user opt-in." Confirm that's still how the
    scan-prds path treats it (vs. queued-but-not-ticking). The
    continuity fleet's whole shape depends on the user reviewing each
    PRD before /build advances — please don't auto-flip the flag.

## 2026-05-24T22:30  /dream  vision-cadence
Drafted: PRD-cadence-substrate.md, PRD-cadence-bind-daily-receipt.md,
  PRD-cadence-bind-confidant.md, PRD-cadence-bind-letters.md,
  PRD-cadence-bind-zine.md, PRD-cadence-bind-reliquary.md,
  PRD-cadence-pulse.md (7 PRDs, Fleet 1).
Vision: visions/cadence.md (composes the existing reflective time-pyramid
  — daily-receipt/confidant/letters-we-never-sent/conversations-zine/
  memory-reliquary — by adding one shared substrate at
  ~/.claude/cadence/ + one CLI + six thin bind-extensions so each tier
  records what it produces and reads what the tier below produced).

**Default rule applied — ATTENTION /build:** all 7 PRDs carry
  `build_auto: false`. User reviews each before /build advances.

**Sequencing for /build (once authorized):**
  - PRD-cadence-substrate MUST ship first (foundational; nothing else
    can use the substrate's CLI until it exists). It's a new repo at
    ~/wintermute/cadence/, rust-cli, not rust-extend.
  - The five bind PRDs (daily-receipt → confidant → letters → zine →
    reliquary) are mutually independent and can ship in any order
    or in parallel. They tolerate a half-bound pyramid — each bind's
    intake gracefully falls back to existing behavior when its
    upstream tier hasn't shipped yet.
  - PRD-cadence-pulse depends ONLY on substrate, not on binds. Worth
    shipping right after substrate even before any bind lands; the
    empty-substrate output ("everything overdue: never") is itself
    honest signal.

**Cross-fleet coordination:**
  - No collision with wintermute fleet (different repo set entirely).
  - No collision with continuity fleet (continuity is per-session /
    kernel-boot-gated; cadence is per-day-and-up / userspace).
  - Recall fleet (recall-daemon, recall-outcome-feedback,
    recall-session-stamp, recall-bash-response-richness,
    recall-braid-freshness-tunable, recall-stop-hook-session-id):
    cadence doesn't touch recall directly. memory-reliquary already
    reads recall; cadence-bind-reliquary leaves that intake path
    intact and only adds the quarterly section.
  - build-rust-extend (shipped, v0.4.1+) is the rail every bind PRD
    uses. All six rust-extend PRDs honor the existing extend pattern:
    no re-init, version bump, install via `cargo install --path .`,
    CHANGELOG.md, push to existing remote.

**Notes for /build:**
  - PRD-cadence-substrate is the only new-repo PRD in this fleet
    (rust-cli, build_into not set — uses the standard `gh repo create
    j0yen/cadence` path). The other six are rust-extend.
  - Each bind PRD's `build_into` points to an existing repo; the
    binary names are mixed (`daily-receipt`, `confidant`,
    `letter-curate`, `zine`, `reliquary`) — verify the crate Cargo.toml
    name before bumping (verified during /dream Phase 1).
  - The shell-out approach (binds call `cadence record/list` as
    subprocesses, not as a Rust lib dep) is intentional. Keeps the
    binds decoupled and lets cadence evolve without churning five
    Cargo.toml files.

**Open questions for /build:**
  - Is the empty-substrate pulse output ("overdue: never") good UX or
    too noisy? The PRD bets on honest > polite. Confirm during pulse
    review.
  - Should the substrate auto-register tools the first time `cadence
    record` is called by a previously-unknown tool? PRD says no
    (explicit `register` only). User may want the convenience; leave
    for v0.3 once feedback exists.

**Fleet 2 bullets (not drafted this pass):**
  - cadence thread <topic> — cross-tier topic trace
  - cadence deck — printable wall-calendar PDF
  - cadence share — encrypted publish
  - ambient integration — tonal shift on missed-tier signal
  - cadence prune — substrate cleanup (after idempotency settled)
  - SessionStart hook auto-install (depends on cadence-pulse landing)
  - Possible per-session tier (only if continuity's session-postmortem
    demands it)

**Still pending from earlier /dream notes:**
  - wintermute-glow once bootstrap+platform ship (no change)
  - wintermute-offline-persona once brain is up (no change)
  - continuity Fleet 2 after >=3 of 5 Fleet 1 PRDs ship (no change)
  - wintermute Fleet 2 after >=3 of 7 Fleet 1 PRDs ship (no change)

## 2026-05-25T05:25  /dream  vision-chord
Drafted: PRD-chord-intent-rich.md, PRD-chord-claim.md,
  PRD-chord-async-delegate.md, PRD-chord-cross-episode.md (4 PRDs, Fleet 1).
Vision: visions/chord.md (cross-session orchestration — the four-PRD
  thin coordination layer atop agorabus that turns 3 concurrent sessions
  from noise into a chord. Three white-space gaps identified during
  Phase 1 research: synchronous head-of-line-blocking delegate.run,
  empty `intent` field on heartbeats, no soft-lock primitive, and
  episodic-observer being single-session by design).

**Default rule applied — ATTENTION /build:** all 4 PRDs carry
  `build_auto: false`. User reviews each before /build advances.

**Sequencing for /build (once authorized):**
  - PRD-chord-intent-rich is foundational; ship first. Adds `skill`,
    `prd_slug`, `working_paths[]` to heartbeat envelope; minor agorabus
    version bump (0.1 → 0.2).
  - PRD-chord-claim depends on intent's `working_paths` schema but
    only loosely; can ship in either order with intent. Both are
    rust-extend on the same repo (~/wintermute/agorabus); bundle
    versioning if shipped close together.
  - PRD-chord-async-delegate is build_target:shell (extends
    ~/.claude/scripts/agorabus-worker.sh + adds a new
    agorabus-delegate-runner.sh helper). Independent of the agorabus
    rust-extend pair. Plus a follow-up commit to AGORABUS_RPC.md (the
    doc, not code) updating it from v0.1 → v0.2.
  - PRD-chord-cross-episode is rust-extend on episodic-observer.
    Soft-depends on chord-intent-rich for high-fidelity
    `working_paths` filtering, and on chord-claim for AC5
    suppression. Degrades gracefully if either upstream isn't live —
    explicitly named in the Risks section.

**Cross-fleet coordination:**
  - No collision with wintermute fleet (different repo set; voice
    laptop is orthogonal to developer-tooling layer).
  - No collision with continuity fleet — they compose: an agentns
    session id (continuity Fleet 1) is exactly the kind of stable
    handle chord-intent-rich wants to broadcast. Once the kernel
    boots and agentns is live, the two visions reinforce each other.
  - No collision with cadence — cadence is per-day-and-up reflection;
    chord is per-second-and-up coordination. A cross-session episode
    feeding into cadence's daily-receipt is a Fleet-2-or-later
    composition idea, not a coupling.
  - Recall fleet: chord-cross-episode reads agorabus events alongside
    transcripts; recall isn't touched directly. Once recall-daemon
    (in flight, iter-2) ships and provides a sub-10ms query path,
    chord-cross-episode could optionally query recall to enrich
    candidates with prior memories. Not in this fleet.

**Important corrections discovered during Phase 1:**
  - `AGORABUS_RPC.md` v0.1 changelog (2026-05-23) says "no handler
    implementations shipped" — this is **stale**. The shipped worker
    at `~/.claude/scripts/agorabus-worker.sh` already implements
    ping/self.describe/methods.list/delegate.run. The chord PRDs
    update the convention doc to v0.2 alongside the async-delegate
    code changes.
  - Feedback memory `feedback_delegate_run_300s_cap.md` says
    "hardcodes timeout 300s" — partially stale: the timeout is
    per-call overridable via `params.timeout_secs`, but the
    *head-of-line blocking* is the real underlying problem. The
    chord-async-delegate PRD addresses both (configurable ttl + non-
    blocking ticket pattern).

**Notes for /build:**
  - PRD-chord-async-delegate is the only `build_target: shell` PRD in
    this fleet (no Cargo.toml, no /autobuilder cycle). It edits two
    files in ~/.claude/scripts/ and adds one new helper script.
    /build's shell path should handle this; if it doesn't, defer
    until /dream extends /build for it.
  - Both rust-extend agorabus PRDs target a v0.2 minor bump.
    Coordinate so they don't both try to claim v0.2.0 simultaneously
    — recall-daemon vs recall-outcome-feedback had exactly this
    collision (resolved by rebasing one to v0.5.1+).
    Recommendation: intent-rich is v0.2.0, claim is v0.2.1 (patch
    bump on second). Or, if both ship in one PR, intent-rich is
    v0.2.0 and claim folds in as part of the same minor.
  - episodic-observer is currently v0.1.0; cross-episode bumps to
    v0.2.0.

**Open questions for /build:**
  - chord-async-delegate's worker-restart story for in-flight tickets:
    runner uses `setsid` so survives, but ticket state file may be
    stale-marked on next worker start. The AC names "scan tickets dir
    on boot, mark stale-running as failed:'worker_restart'" — confirm
    that lands in /build's first iter, not deferred.
  - Naming: `chord` was chosen during /dream because it's short,
    evocative (concurrent notes coordinating into one sound), and not
    taken in ~/wintermute/. If user prefers another name (consort,
    council, concert, concord), rename the vision file + all four
    PRDs together. Captured in visions/chord.md §Open questions.

**Fleet 2 bullets (not drafted this pass, captured in visions/chord.md):**
  - chord-peek — `agorabus peek <peer-sid>` wrapping an RPC
    `self.recent_tools` method
  - chord-peer-review — PostToolUse hook publishes
    `code.commit.<repo>`; peers can offer review
  - chord-method-discovery — `methods.list` returns capability
    table + custom registration
  - chord-quorum — multi-session agreement for risky shared actions
  - chord-handoff — exiting session hands off intent + claims to
    a peer

Draft Fleet 2 after ≥2 of 4 Fleet 1 PRDs ship.

**Still pending from earlier /dream notes:**
  - wintermute-glow once bootstrap+platform ship (no change)
  - wintermute-offline-persona once brain is up (no change)
  - continuity Fleet 2 after ≥3 of 5 Fleet 1 PRDs ship (no change)
  - wintermute Fleet 2 after ≥3 of 7 Fleet 1 PRDs ship (no change)
  - cadence Fleet 2 after ≥1 of 7 Fleet 1 PRDs ship (no change)

## 2026-05-25T06:30  /dream  vision-freshness
Drafted: PRD-recall-doctor-claims.md (1 PRD, Fleet 1).
Vision: visions/freshness.md (single-PRD vision; Fleet 2 bullets
  captured but explicitly NOT drafted per dream rule 6 — "don't
  dream past the research").

**Why this pass was narrow.** Bare /dream invocation arriving ~50min
after vision-chord drop (5th /dream in <30h, 4 active visions, 28
PRDs queued, only 1 shipped today). Saturation is real. The honest
move was either (a) ask the user, or (b) pick the smallest genuinely
new gap and stop. User declined the AskUserQuestion offer; I went
with (b).

**The gap:** during chord-vision Phase 1 grounded research I caught
two stale claims in one hour — `feedback_delegate_run_300s_cap`
asserts "hardcodes" but the timeout is per-call overridable;
`AGORABUS_RPC.md` v0.1 changelog says "no handlers shipped" but
ping/self.describe/methods.list/delegate.run all ship today. These
were caught only because Phase 1 happened to read both the
memory/doc AND the live source in the same hour. A deliberate
sweep would catch more. That's the entire motivation. One PRD,
one tool, parks proposals for the user to review.

**Default rule applied — ATTENTION /build:** PRD-recall-doctor-claims
carries `build_auto: false`. User reviews before /build advances.

**Sequencing for /build (once authorized):**
  - Single PRD; no internal ordering. Independent of every other
    in-flight recall PRD because v0.7.0 reserves clean space
    (v0.5.0 recall-daemon, v0.5.1-0.5.3 recall-outcome-feedback,
    v0.6.0 recall-session-stamp). If another recall PRD jumps the
    line, rebase to next free minor — explicitly named in PRD §Notes.
  - rust-extend on ~/wintermute/recall. Same mechanical path as
    recall-observer-correlation v0.4.2 (shipped today).
  - One new module src/doctor_claims.rs + clap flag on existing
    `doctor` subcommand. No new top-level command.

**Cross-fleet coordination:**
  - Composes with continuity Fleet 2 (freshness-doc-sweep in F2
    would consume provfs xattrs to know which session wrote which
    doc; useful once kernel boots).
  - Composes with chord-cross-episode (freshness-cross-session-witness
    in F2 would surface when two sessions disagree about a fact).
  - Composes with cadence (a quarterly "freshness audit" tier
    entry would feed memory-reliquary).
  - Composes with itself: this very PRD will go stale. When
    `recall doctor --check-claims` first runs against the
    eventually-promoted version of this PRD, it'll be a good early
    self-test.

**Notes for /build:**
  - AC5 sets a 30% false-positive ceiling on the extractor. If
    iter-1 trips this, tighten extraction patterns (drop
    prose-path matching; only check fenced-code paths) before
    iter-2; don't ship a noisy tool.
  - AC10 requires a real round-trip — jsy reviews at least one
    actual proposal generated against the live store. Don't
    mark shipped on synthetic proofs alone. The proposal review
    flow already exists (recall observe / proposals / promote);
    this just adds a new source tag (`source: doctor-claims`).

**Fleet 2 bullets (NOT drafted, captured in visions/freshness.md):**
  - freshness-claims-rich (extend extractor for hardcoded/always/never
    qualifiers)
  - freshness-doc-sweep (apply checker to READMEs + CHANGELOGs +
    CLAUDE_SELF.md)
  - freshness-self-changelog (CLAUDE_SELF.md changelog specifically)
  - freshness-on-recall (lazy re-check on `recall query` hit)
  - freshness-cross-session-witness (compose with chord-cross-episode)

Draft Fleet 2 after Fleet 1 ships AND the proposal queue produces
at least one user-promoted supersede.

**Still pending from earlier /dream notes:**
  - wintermute-glow once bootstrap+platform ship (no change)
  - wintermute-offline-persona once brain is up (no change)
  - continuity Fleet 2 after >=3 of 5 Fleet 1 PRDs ship (no change)
  - wintermute Fleet 2 after >=3 of 7 Fleet 1 PRDs ship (no change)
  - cadence Fleet 2 after >=1 of 7 Fleet 1 PRDs ship (no change)
  - chord Fleet 2 after >=2 of 4 Fleet 1 PRDs ship (no change)

## 2026-05-25T07:50  /dream  no-fleet-pass
Bare /dream invocation, 80min after vision-freshness. **No new fleet
drafted this pass** — per dream rule 6 ("don't dream past the
research"). Three reasons:

  1. Saturation: 5 active visions, 28 PRDs queued, 1 shipped today.
     Bottleneck is /build throughput, not /dream supply.
  2. No new evidence since 06:30 (no PRD shipped, kernel still on
     7.0.9 stock, no journal entry for today).
  3. User declined the AskUserQuestion offering 4 directions
     (specific topic / extend existing / status only / dream anyway).
     Honest move was option (b) from the freshness pass — go narrow
     or don't go — and this time "don't go" is the truth.

**One micro-finding this pass DID surface,** worth capturing here so
it isn't lost: the 06:30 freshness-gossip note cites `ctrace ls` as
a Phase 1 command. `ctrace ls` is not a valid subcommand — actual
subcommands are `start|stop|status|query|tail`. This is exactly the
class of staleness that `PRD-recall-doctor-claims` was drafted to
catch (extended in Fleet 2's freshness-doc-sweep to cover gossip /
skill docs). Logged as evidence in `visions/freshness.md` §Evidence
log; strengthens the Fleet 2 case once Fleet 1 ships.

**Notes for /build:** nothing new. Continue with current in_progress
PRDs (build-rust-extend AC-10 verification, recall-daemon iter-3,
wintermute-bootstrap/platform/tts in-flight). No new dependencies
introduced by this /dream pass.

**Notes for next /dream:** real new evidence the laptop could
produce that would unblock a grounded vision:
  - kernel boots into linux-wintermute → continuity Fleet 1 boot-
    gated ACs become testable → grounded basis for continuity
    Fleet 2.
  - any single in_progress PRD ships → gossip-trigger to draft its
    Fleet-2 follow-on per the existing rules in earlier gossip
    notes (chord ≥2, continuity ≥3, wintermute ≥3, cadence ≥1).
  - a real new user-articulated topic.
  Without one of those, the next bare /dream should also be a
  no-fleet-pass. Two in a row is not a problem — it's the system
  working correctly.

**Pending from earlier /dream notes (unchanged):**
  - wintermute-glow once bootstrap+platform ship
  - wintermute-offline-persona once brain is up
  - continuity Fleet 2 after >=3 of 5 Fleet 1 PRDs ship
  - wintermute Fleet 2 after >=3 of 7 Fleet 1 PRDs ship
  - cadence Fleet 2 after >=1 of 7 Fleet 1 PRDs ship
  - chord Fleet 2 after >=2 of 4 Fleet 1 PRDs ship
  - freshness Fleet 2 after Fleet 1 ships + 1 promoted supersede

## 2026-05-25T07:50  /dream  vision-handshake
Drafted: PRD-agorabus-boot-handshake.md (1 PRD, Fleet 1).
Vision: visions/handshake.md (single-PRD vision; Fleet 2 bullets
  captured but explicitly NOT drafted per dream rule 6).

**Why this pass wasn't a no-fleet-pass.** Last note (~07:50) said
the next bare /dream should also be no-fleet unless real new
evidence arrived. Three new pieces of evidence DID arrive in the
intervening hours:
  1. **recall v0.4.3 shipped** (`2df7156 recall v0.4.3: braid
     freshness tunable, default 60s → 300s`) — 2nd ship today
     after v0.4.2 observer-correlation. /build throughput is
     better than yesterday.
  2. **2026-05-25 self-review entry exists** at
     `~/brain/journal/2026-05-25.md` (was empty at 07:50 pass).
     §Notable identifies a new bug class: post-reboot startup
     race in `agorabus-session-start.sh` produces orphan
     subscribers when daemon-not-ready races the hook's 0.5s
     socket-wait under boot load. PID 917 hit it today.
     Journal explicitly proposes the fix.
  3. **Kernel build PID 12146 still running** at load 10.42 —
     same conditions that produced today's race. Bug is
     reproducible and current.

This satisfies the "narrow gap with grounded new evidence"
heuristic from the 06:30 freshness pass. One small shell-target
PRD, single-PRD vision (same pattern as `freshness`).

**Default rule applied — ATTENTION /build:**
PRD-agorabus-boot-handshake carries `build_auto: false`. User
reviews before /build advances.

**Sequencing for /build (once authorized):**
  - Single PRD, no internal ordering.
  - **build_target: shell.** /build's shell-target path may not
    yet be hardened (chord-async-delegate is the only other
    in-flight shell PRD; it hasn't shipped). If /build can't run
    shell yet, defer this PRD until /dream extends /build for
    shell. The handshake bug is real but not blocking; current
    self-review playbook (escalate to user) is workable in the
    meantime.
  - One file edited: `~/.claude/scripts/agorabus-session-start.sh`.
    No new files. No version bump (script has no version).
  - AC8 and AC10 require manual verification (synthetic load /
    reboot); /build should ship to AC7 + AC9 mechanically and
    mark AC8/AC10 as user-verify checkpoints, same pattern as
    recall-observer-correlation.

**Cross-fleet coordination:**
  - **chord-async-delegate** is the only other shell-target PRD
    in flight; both touch `~/.claude/scripts/`. No file collision
    (chord-async-delegate adds new files; this PRD edits one
    existing file). Sequence so the handshake fix lands first —
    chord-async-delegate assumes a reliable bus.
  - **continuity Fleet 1** — once agentns boots, subscribe will
    use 128-bit agentns session ids instead of PID-derived ones.
    Handshake verification logic is sid-agnostic, so no rework.
  - **freshness / cadence / wintermute** — none.

**Notes for /build:**
  - The retry parameters (10 × 0.3s socket-wait; 10 × 0.3s peer-
    record poll with one re-spawn after 10 attempts) are tuned
    for today's boot conditions. Surface any tuning learnings
    back to PRD's §Open questions, not as a code comment.
  - Handshake log directory `~/.cache/agorabus/handshake/` does
    not exist yet; first run creates it. AC7 (log rotation, 14
    days) is the only place the script needs `find` — keep that
    invocation explicit and bounded (no `-exec rm -rf`).
  - Do not auto-merge / install to live `~/.claude/scripts/`
    without jsy testing one session first. This file is on the
    Claude startup path.

**Fleet 2 bullets (NOT drafted, captured in visions/handshake.md):**
  - handshake-reannounce-on-watch-loss (daemon-side `peer.lost`
    broadcast)
  - handshake-daemon-ready-fd (marker file instead of socket
    poll)
  - handshake-reattach-cli (`agorabus reattach <sid>` for
    orphan recovery)
  - handshake-startup-race-pevent (supervised daemon launch)
  - handshake-prom-counters (race/orphan/recover counters)

Draft Fleet 2 after Fleet 1 ships AND at least one race is
observed + recovered in `~/.cache/agorabus/handshake/` logs.

**Still pending from earlier /dream notes (unchanged):**
  - wintermute-glow once bootstrap+platform ship
  - wintermute-offline-persona once brain is up
  - continuity Fleet 2 after >=3 of 5 Fleet 1 PRDs ship
  - wintermute Fleet 2 after >=3 of 7 Fleet 1 PRDs ship
  - cadence Fleet 2 after >=1 of 7 Fleet 1 PRDs ship
  - chord Fleet 2 after >=2 of 4 Fleet 1 PRDs ship
  - freshness Fleet 2 after Fleet 1 ships + 1 promoted supersede

## 2026-05-25T08:30  /dream  no-fleet-pass
Bare `/dream`, 40min after vision-handshake. **No new fleet drafted
this pass** — second consecutive no-fleet-pass, exactly the cadence
the 07:50 no-fleet note predicted ("two in a row is not a problem").

**State delta since vision-handshake (07:50):**
  1. **linux-wintermute kernel pkgs are now sitting on disk**:
     `~/wintermute/wintermute-kernel/pkg/linux-wintermute-7.0.10.arch1-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst`
     (154MB) + headers (43MB), both timestamped May 25 00:54.
     The build finished ~7h *before* the 07:50 handshake pass
     cited "PID 12146 still running" as live evidence. PID 12146
     is gone now. The handshake PRD's *core* premise (the orphan-
     for-PID-917 race is real and current; see journal §Notable)
     remains valid; only its third supporting fact was stale.
  2. **recall-daemon iter-3 committed** at 08:26 (4min ago,
     e51b9a2): query/embed/touch wired against open Index +
     built Embedder, lib 31/31 + integration 4/4 green. Still
     pre-ship; v0.5.0 lands after iter-4 (CLI auto-forward +
     systemd-user unit).
  3. **stock 7.0.9 still booted.** linux-wintermute is install-
     ready but not installed. User decision: `sudo pacman -U`
     the two pkg.tar.zst files (alongside the 29-pkg queue still
     blocked on protected substrings) and reboot to unlock
     memlog / provfs / agentns.

**Why no fleet was drafted:**
  - Triggers from the 07:50 no-fleet rules:
      * any in-flight PRD ships → recall-daemon hasn't (iter-3 of 4)
      * kernel boots → not yet (build done, not booted)
      * new user articulation → none
  - Saturation unchanged: 5 active visions, 29 PRDs queued, 0
    additional shipped since handshake. /build remains the
    bottleneck, not /dream supply.

**One micro-finding logged this pass** (added to
`visions/freshness.md` §Evidence log): the 07:50 handshake gossip
note cited a fact that was already 7h stale at the time of writing.
This is exactly the freshness-on-gossip class. Surfaces a new Fleet 2
candidate beyond the original five: `freshness-on-dream` — spot-check
load-bearing claims in fresh gossip drafts before they commit. Not
drafted; bullet captured in vision file.

**Notes for /build:** unchanged. Continue with current in_progress
PRDs (recall-daemon iter-4 is the visible next ship; wintermute-
bootstrap/platform/tts still in-flight; build-rust-extend AC-10 done).
No new dependencies introduced.

**Notes for next /dream:** evidence that would unblock a real fleet:
  - **recall-daemon ships to v0.5.0** → recall fleet can extend with
    daemon-aware follow-ons (already partly covered by recall-outcome-
    feedback's rebase to v0.5.1-v0.5.3, but check before drafting).
  - **kernel boots into linux-wintermute** → continuity Fleet 1
    boot-gated ACs become testable → grounded basis for continuity
    Fleet 2. This is the single biggest unblock available; one
    user action (`pacman -U` + reboot) shifts the entire substrate.
  - **any other single in-flight PRD ships** → its Fleet-2 trigger
    fires (chord ≥2, continuity ≥3, wintermute ≥3, cadence ≥1).
  - **a real new user-articulated topic.**

If none of those land before the next bare /dream, a third
no-fleet-pass is the right call. The discipline holds.

**Still pending from earlier /dream notes (unchanged):**
  - wintermute-glow once bootstrap+platform ship
  - wintermute-offline-persona once brain is up
  - continuity Fleet 2 after >=3 of 5 Fleet 1 PRDs ship
  - wintermute Fleet 2 after >=3 of 7 Fleet 1 PRDs ship
  - cadence Fleet 2 after >=1 of 7 Fleet 1 PRDs ship
  - chord Fleet 2 after >=2 of 4 Fleet 1 PRDs ship
  - freshness Fleet 2 after Fleet 1 ships + 1 promoted supersede

## 2026-05-25T09:15  /dream  no-fleet-pass
Bare `/dream`, 45min after the 08:30 no-fleet-pass. **Third
consecutive no-fleet-pass** — exactly the cadence the 08:30 note
predicted ("a third no-fleet-pass is the right call. The discipline
holds.").

**State delta since 08:30:**
  1. **recall v0.4.3 shipped twice**: commit 2df7156 (braid
     freshness tunable, default 60s → 300s) + commit fdc81ad
     (CHANGELOG backfill). This is **PRD-recall-braid-freshness-
     tunable.md** landing in code. Cargo.toml now reports 0.4.3;
     CHANGELOG.md has the v0.4.3 section.
  2. recall-daemon: still iter-3 (no iter-4, no v0.5.0). No new
     commits past e51b9a2.
  3. kernel: still stock 7.0.9 booted. `~/wintermute/wintermute-
     kernel/pkg/linux-wintermute-7.0.10.arch1-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst`
     unchanged from 00:54.
  4. No new user articulation (bare /dream).

**Why no fleet drafted:**
  - The recall-braid-freshness-tunable ship is an **orphan-PRD ship**:
    NOT in any active vision (the freshness vision is about
    `recall doctor --check-claims` for memory bodies; this PRD is
    about the *braid correlator's* fresh-tool-result window — a
    different "freshness"). NOT in the build manifest's `prds`
    object (manifest read confirms only build-rust-extend,
    agentic-memory, recall-daemon, recall-observer-correlation,
    recall-outcome-feedback, plus notebooks/wintermute-audio).
    Therefore the ship fires NONE of the six Fleet 2 triggers
    (chord ≥2, continuity ≥3, wintermute ≥3, cadence ≥1, freshness
    ≥1, handshake ≥1 — all still at 0).
  - Triggers from 08:30's no-fleet rules:
      * recall-daemon to v0.5.0 → no (still iter-3)
      * kernel boots → no
      * any in-flight **Fleet 1** PRD ships → no (orphan ship
        doesn't count)
      * new user articulation → no
  - Saturation unchanged: 6 active visions, ~28 PRDs queued, /build
    remains the bottleneck.

**One micro-finding logged this pass — orphan-PRD desync:**
  Three recall-* PRDs target v0.4.x extension work but live as
  orphan drafts (no vision, no manifest tracking):
    - **PRD-recall-braid-freshness-tunable.md** — Status line still
      reads "Draft v0.1" but the work is in main at v0.4.3 (commit
      2df7156). PRD file is still in the queue dir, NOT archived.
      Self-referential drift: the PRD's frontmatter is a stale
      claim about its own implementation state.
    - **PRD-recall-bash-response-richness.md** — "Draft v0.1",
      "Builds on recall v0.4.2", not yet shipped.
    - **PRD-recall-stop-hook-session-id.md** — "Draft v0.1",
      "Builds on recall v0.4.2", not yet shipped.
  This is on-theme for the freshness vision (a document body whose
  claims about live state are wrong). Logged into
  `visions/freshness.md` §Evidence log; not drafted as a new PRD
  per dream rule 6.

**Notes for /build:** when next ticking
PRD-recall-braid-freshness-tunable.md: the work is already in
main. Reconcile — either archive the PRD as shipped (preferred) or
detect the version-already-bumped state in `scan-prds.sh` and skip.
A natural rule: "if PRD `Builds on: recall vX.Y.Z` and live
Cargo.toml version > X.Y.Z, flag for archival." Other orphan PRDs
unchanged; recall-daemon iter-4 remains the visible next ship.

**Notes for next /dream:** same unblock conditions as 08:30,
plus one new sign-post:
  - recall-daemon to v0.5.0 → recall fleet gets daemon-aware
    follow-ons.
  - kernel boots into linux-wintermute → continuity Fleet 1
    boot-gated ACs become testable; single biggest unblock.
  - any **Fleet 1** PRD ships (six fleets, six triggers).
  - a real new user-articulated topic.
  - **NEW: if a 4th orphan-PRD ship lands without reconciliation**,
    consider a small "recall-pulse" vision that retroactively folds
    the orphan recall-* PRDs under one umbrella. Holding back per
    dream rule 6 until at least one more orphan ship occurs.

If none of these land before the next bare /dream, a fourth
no-fleet-pass is the right call. The discipline still holds.

**Still pending from earlier /dream notes (unchanged):**
  - wintermute-glow once bootstrap+platform ship
  - wintermute-offline-persona once brain is up
  - continuity Fleet 2 after >=3 of 5 Fleet 1 PRDs ship
  - wintermute Fleet 2 after >=3 of 7 Fleet 1 PRDs ship
  - cadence Fleet 2 after >=1 of 7 Fleet 1 PRDs ship
  - chord Fleet 2 after >=2 of 4 Fleet 1 PRDs ship
  - freshness Fleet 2 after Fleet 1 ships + 1 promoted supersede
  - handshake Fleet 2 after Fleet 1 ships + 1 observed race

## 2026-05-25T10:00  /dream  no-fleet-pass
Bare `/dream`, 45min after 09:15. **Fourth consecutive no-fleet-pass**
— the call 09:15 predicted ("a fourth no-fleet-pass is the right
call").

**State delta since 09:15:**
  1. /build hit a sustained throughput stall between 02:17–02:58 PT
     (09:17Z–09:58Z): 9 cron fires, 0 successful ticks. Six fires
     bounced on `tick.lock` held by a sibling timer-fired tick;
     three bounced on classifier-unavailable. PID 481429 finally
     took the lock at 02:58 (currently in-flight, 3min elapsed).
     Net result: no commits from 09:15Z onward across Fleet 1.
  2. recall-daemon: still iter-3, last_action 08:26Z. No v0.5.0.
  3. recall tip: still `fdc81ad` (v0.4.3 CHANGELOG backfill). No
     new ships, no new orphan PRDs.
  4. wintermute-bootstrap manifest now `last_action: 09:15Z` —
     iter-5 (AC4 OnceStart, commit 796852b at 09:08Z) re-touched
     during the 09:15 dream window; still in_progress (AC1+AC3
     deferred). Not a Fleet-2-trigger ship.
  5. wintermute-platform manifest `last_action: 09:02Z` — iter-9
     clippy fix (5b10fb6 at 08:57Z); still in_progress.
  6. Kernel: stock 7.0.9-arch1-1, pkgs unchanged at 00:54.
  7. No new user articulation; bare /dream.

**Why no fleet drafted:**
  - None of the six unblock conditions fired (recall-daemon→v0.5.0,
    kernel boot, any Fleet 1 ship, new orphan ship for recall-pulse
    hook, user articulation, …). The build-tick contention pattern
    is a /build hygiene issue, not vision-shaped: it surfaces a
    candidate fix (timer interval > expected wall time, or
    self-contention exit-fast), but the fix author is /build, not
    /dream, and a PRD would be misshaped here.

**One micro-finding logged this pass — /build self-contention:**
  systemd-user timer interval is 5min; observed wall time between
  09:17Z and 09:58Z had multiple concurrent `claude-build-headless.sh`
  processes (PIDs 474583 / 476041 / 476669 / 478094 / 479993 / 481429
  in sequence, several overlapping for >5min). When classifier
  flaps add 60–90s retries on top of an already-long tick, the
  cron cadence is shorter than steady-state wall time and ticks
  race themselves. Phase 0's lock-guard absorbs the contention
  (every loser exits cleanly without mutating state — that part
  works), but the *cost* is that 9 of 9 fires in 41min did zero
  PRD-advance work; the wall-clock advance rate during the stall
  was 0 commits/41min vs the baseline of ~1 commit per cron-fire.
  This is not new from a steady-state perspective (the lock guard
  is doing its job) but it IS a new visible bottleneck shape
  that wasn't present at 09:15. Logged to gossip; future /dream
  should NOT draft a PRD for this — it's /build's domain to widen
  the cron interval, add a self-detect-running early-exit, or
  collapse classifier retries.

**Notes for /build:** when the in-flight PID 481429 tick completes,
consider:
  - widening the systemd-user timer to 10min (matches observed
    p95 wall time including classifier flap retries), OR
  - early-exit if a sibling has been running >2min (the lock
    age is detectable via `ls -la tick.lock` mtime).
  This is a /build-skill self-mod, not a /dream PRD; surfacing as
  a finding for next /self-review or /build's own Phase 6
  follow-on draft. recall-daemon iter-4 (CLI auto-forward +
  systemd-user unit toward v0.5.0) is still the visible next ship
  if the throughput stall clears.

**Notes for next /dream:** unblock conditions unchanged from 09:15.
A fifth no-fleet-pass is appropriate if none have fired by the
next bare /dream. The discipline still holds — it explicitly
predicts itself one step out.

**Still pending from earlier /dream notes (unchanged):**
  - wintermute-glow once bootstrap+platform ship
  - wintermute-offline-persona once brain is up
  - continuity Fleet 2 after >=3 of 5 Fleet 1 PRDs ship
  - wintermute Fleet 2 after >=3 of 7 Fleet 1 PRDs ship
  - cadence Fleet 2 after >=1 of 7 Fleet 1 PRDs ship
  - chord Fleet 2 after >=2 of 4 Fleet 1 PRDs ship
  - freshness Fleet 2 after Fleet 1 ships + 1 promoted supersede
  - handshake Fleet 2 after Fleet 1 ships + 1 observed race

## 2026-05-25T10:45  /dream  no-fleet-pass
Bare `/dream`, 45min after 10:00. **Fifth consecutive no-fleet-pass** —
the call 10:00 predicted ("a fifth no-fleet-pass is appropriate if
none have fired by the next bare /dream").

**State delta since 10:00:**
  1. /build throughput: the in-flight PID 481429 tick that 10:00
     described as "3min elapsed" eventually completed without
     advancing any Fleet 1 PRD ship. Wintermute-bootstrap last_action
     unchanged from 09:15Z; wintermute-platform 09:02Z; wintermute-tts
     06:09Z; recall-daemon 08:26Z. No Fleet 1 ships in the 45min
     window.
  2. recall tip: still `fdc81ad` (v0.4.3 CHANGELOG backfill).
  3. recall-daemon: still iter-3, no v0.5.0.
  4. Kernel: still booted on stock 7.0.9-arch1-1. `linux-wintermute-
     7.0.10.arch1-1` pkg unchanged from 00:54.
  5. No new user articulation.

**Why no fleet drafted:**
  - None of the six unblock conditions fired (recall-daemon→v0.5.0,
    kernel boot, any Fleet 1 PRD ship, new orphan-PRD ship for
    recall-pulse hook, user articulation, …).

**Self-correction logged this pass — meta-freshness:**
  The 09:15 gossip note about recall-braid-freshness-tunable as an
  "orphan-PRD ship" had a stale claim of its own. Quoted:
    > "NOT in the build manifest's prds object (manifest read
    >  confirms only build-rust-extend, agentic-memory,
    >  recall-daemon, recall-observer-correlation,
    >  recall-outcome-feedback, plus notebooks/wintermute-audio)."
  Live re-check at 10:45Z: the PRD has been in the manifest since
  iter-1 at 04:50Z — 4h17m before the 09:15 dream pass called it an
  orphan. Manifest now shows status=in_progress (3 ticks),
  shipped_version=0.4.3, changelog_committed=fdc81ad,
  installed_versions={recall: 0.4.3, recalld: 0.4.3}. What's
  actually pending: archival (move PRD to PRDs-archive/, flip
  status to shipped). The 09:15 narrative confused
  "manifest doesn't track this PRD" with "PRD frontmatter still
  reads Draft v0.1" — a different fact, and the only true one.
  Likely cause: I read manifest at 09:15 but truncated mid-object
  via `head -100`; the recall-braid-* entry sits after the first
  five PRDs alphabetically and was below my window.

  This is on-theme for vision-freshness with extra force: the
  artifact whose claims drifted is gossip.md itself, drafted by
  the same skill that exists to *write* drift-free notes about
  ground truth. The freshness-on-dream Fleet 2 candidate (logged
  08:30) is reinforced: a spot-check pass over dream's own
  outputs before commit would have caught this.

  Logged into visions/freshness.md §Evidence log; not drafted
  per dream rule 6. Pattern now has FOUR instances:
    - feedback_delegate_run_300s_cap.md "hardcodes" wording
    - AGORABUS_RPC.md v0.1 changelog "no handler shipped"
    - 06:30 gossip's `ctrace ls` invocation (invalid subcommand)
    - 09:15 gossip's orphan-PRD-manifest claim (false)
  Last two were authored by /dream itself within the last 6h.

**Notes for /build:** the actionable hint from 09:15 is still valid
in spirit but more specific in shape — recall-braid-freshness-tunable
needs an **archival tick** (status:in_progress → status:shipped, mv
PRD to PRDs-archive/), not version-bump work. The
build_stale_blockers playbook may not currently detect "all version
work is done, only archival remains" as a discrete state — worth a
/build-side check on its own scan logic. recall-daemon iter-4 (CLI
auto-forward + systemd-user unit toward v0.5.0) remains the visible
next ship.

**Notes for next /dream:** unblock conditions unchanged. A sixth
no-fleet-pass is appropriate if none have fired by the next bare
/dream. If a sixth pass happens, the discipline-test pattern itself
becomes evidence — proposing it as a Fleet 2 entry for
vision-cadence ("dream rest-pace heuristic: bare /dream within Nmin
of last no-fleet-pass and unchanged state → respond with vision
list + one paragraph instead of a fresh research pass") may be
warranted. Holding back per dream rule 6 until pass six.

**Still pending from earlier /dream notes (unchanged):**
  - wintermute-glow once bootstrap+platform ship
  - wintermute-offline-persona once brain is up
  - continuity Fleet 2 after >=3 of 5 Fleet 1 PRDs ship
  - wintermute Fleet 2 after >=3 of 7 Fleet 1 PRDs ship
  - cadence Fleet 2 after >=1 of 7 Fleet 1 PRDs ship
  - chord Fleet 2 after >=2 of 4 Fleet 1 PRDs ship
  - freshness Fleet 2 after Fleet 1 ships + 1 promoted supersede
  - handshake Fleet 2 after Fleet 1 ships + 1 observed race

## 2026-05-25T11:30  /dream  no-fleet-pass
Bare `/dream`, 45min after 10:45. **Sixth consecutive no-fleet-pass** —
the call 10:45 predicted ("a sixth no-fleet-pass is appropriate if
none have fired by the next bare /dream").

**State delta since 10:45 (real, but sub-threshold):**
  1. `recall-daemon` advanced from iter-3 to **iter-4** at 11:13Z
     (commit `8949d32`, pushed to `origin/main`). New surface:
     `recall daemon status` subcommand (text+json, exit-code on
     liveness) + `contrib/systemd/recalld.service` user-unit +
     `recall where` now reports socket liveness. Lib 31/31 +
     daemon_ping 4/4 unchanged; no version bump (v0.5.0 still
     gated on iter-5 CLI auto-forward).
  2. /build cron has fired ~3x since (11:16/11:21/11:26Z) — all
     bounced on `tick.lock` held by the headless-cron sibling. The
     10:00 self-contention finding persists.
  3. recall tip: `fdc81ad` → `8949d32`.
  4. Kernel: still stock 7.0.9-arch1-1.
  5. No new user articulation.

**Why no fleet drafted:**
  - The iter-4 commit is real motion on `recall-daemon`, but it is
    a within-PRD iteration, not a Fleet 1 ship. The explicit
    trigger from 10:45 (`recall-daemon→v0.5.0`) hasn't fired.
  - None of the other five unblock conditions fired either.

**Fleet 2 candidate landed (per 10:45's tee-up):** added
`dream rest-pace heuristic` as a bullet in `visions/cadence.md`
§Fleet 2. Six consecutive passes is enough evidence the pattern
is real and recurring; cadence is the natural vision-home
(pulse-like signal applied to /dream's own invocation cadence).
This is a vision-doc bullet only, not a drafted PRD — rule 6
still holds; drafting waits for `cadence-pulse` to ship so the
heuristic has a stable substrate to read.

**Discipline-test summary (07:50Z → 11:30Z, 3h40m, 6 passes):**
  - Pass 7 (07:50): saturation + no new evidence
  - Pass 8 (08:30): predicted pass 9; logged stale `ctrace ls`
    + first /dream meta-stale claim (PID 12146 "still running")
  - Pass 9 (09:15): orphan-PRD misread (later self-corrected)
  - Pass 10 (10:00): /build self-contention micro-finding
  - Pass 11 (10:45): self-correction of pass 9's manifest misread;
    teed up the Fleet 2 entry for pass 12
  - Pass 12 (11:30): consumed the tee-up; cadence Fleet 2 bullet
    added; pattern documented as complete.
Every pass logged a state delta. Every pass predicted the next
correctly. Two passes drafted stale claims in their own gossip
(passes 8 and 9), both self-corrected within 2h. Zero PRDs
drafted past evidence. Net writes per pass: 1 gossip entry +
1 manifest append + 0-1 vision-evidence-log lines.

**Notes for /build:** recall-daemon iter-5 (CLI query auto-forward)
is the visible next ship to unlock the v0.5.0 boundary. Once that
lands, the recall-outcome-feedback + recall-session-stamp PRDs
(both pinned behind v0.5.0) become eligible. Tick.lock contention
remains — 10:00 hint (widen timer interval or sibling-age early-
exit) still applicable.

**Notes for next /dream:** unblock conditions unchanged. A seventh
no-fleet-pass would be **excessive**, not disciplined. If state is
still unchanged at the next bare invocation, /dream should follow
its own newly-bulleted rest-pace heuristic spirit: reply with a
one-paragraph state delta + this pass's unblock list, and skip
even the manifest/gossip writes (logging "I did nothing" six times
is itself a noise floor). The bullet exists now; living the bullet
before the PRD ships is acceptable since the change is to /dream's
own behavior, not to a downstream tool.

**Still pending from earlier /dream notes (unchanged):**
  - wintermute-glow once bootstrap+platform ship
  - wintermute-offline-persona once brain is up
  - continuity Fleet 2 after >=3 of 5 Fleet 1 PRDs ship
  - wintermute Fleet 2 after >=3 of 7 Fleet 1 PRDs ship
  - cadence Fleet 2 after >=1 of 7 Fleet 1 PRDs ship
  - chord Fleet 2 after >=2 of 4 Fleet 1 PRDs ship
  - freshness Fleet 2 after Fleet 1 ships + 1 promoted supersede
  - handshake Fleet 2 after Fleet 1 ships + 1 observed race

## 2026-05-25T13:45  /dream  no-fleet-pass (trigger-fired, scope mismatch)
Bare `/dream` 2h15min after 11:30. **Seventh /dream-pass in the
3h40m arc + 2h15m gap; first since-then.** Discipline still holds.

**State delta since 11:30 (real, but vision-orthogonal):**
  1. `recall-daemon` shipped **v0.5.0** at commit `4333b18` somewhere
     between 12:26Z and 13:45Z (manifest snapshot at 12:26Z still
     called iter-5 pre-bump). This is the exact trigger 10:45 and
     11:30 named as the visible next ship to unlock the v0.5.0
     boundary. ✅ FIRED.
  2. Kernel still stock 7.0.9-arch1-1.
  3. No user articulation; bare `/dream`.

**Vision Fleet 1 counts: unchanged.** recall-daemon is a build-manifest
PRD, not in any vision's Fleet 1. None of the six Fleet 2 triggers
(continuity ≥3/5, wintermute ≥3/7, cadence ≥1/7, chord ≥2/4, freshness
≥1/1, handshake ≥1/1) fire. The ship is real motion but
vision-orthogonal.

**Actual downstream unblocks (for /build, not /dream):**
  - `recall-outcome-feedback`: pinned behind v0.5.0, rebases to
    v0.5.1/0.5.2/0.5.3 per its PRD §6 plan. Already drafted; /build
    can pick it up.
  - `recall-session-stamp` (continuity Fleet 1, targets v0.6.0): the
    v0.5.0 collision risk that the continuity vision-doc called out
    is now resolved. Already drafted; /build can pick it up.

**Why no fleet drafted this pass:**
  - The new substrate (UDS socket exposing ping/query-no-filter/embed/
    touch) is minimal. Streaming/subscribe and filter-rich daemon
    queries are NOT exposed; daemon-aware hook PRDs would be real but
    are "dream past the research" — the daemon shipped ~80min ago
    with zero downstream consumers. Wait for at least one consumer to
    tick through /build before imagining the next layer.
  - The 30-PRD queue across 6 visions is the saturating constraint,
    not idea generation.

**Self-application of the cadence-rest-pace heuristic** (from
visions/cadence.md §Fleet 2, banked at 11:30): this pass is the first
since the heuristic was banked. State *did* change — but the change
was build-side (PRD shipped from queue), not dream-side (new
vision-shaped white space). The heuristic was written for "unchanged
state"; this pass tests a refinement — "build-side change with no
fleet-trigger fire." Treating it identically (log state delta + skip
new drafts) is the right read. The PRD `cadence-pulse` should
generalize to "/dream rests when /build advances within an already-
drafted vision; only wakes when a Fleet 2 trigger fires OR new user
articulation arrives OR new kernel/substrate surface lands."

**Notes for /build:** with v0.5.0 shipped, you have two immediately-
eligible PRDs:
  1. recall-outcome-feedback (rebase to v0.5.1/0.5.2/0.5.3)
  2. recall-session-stamp (continuity Fleet 1, v0.6.0)
Pick by priority/heat. Also: the tick.lock self-contention (10:00
finding) probably worth addressing before either, since both are
multi-iter PRDs that will benefit from a less self-racing cron.

**Notes for next /dream:** unblock conditions narrow further now that
recall-daemon→v0.5.0 has cleared:
  - any continuity Fleet 1 ship (5 candidates; recall-session-stamp
    is now the most-eligible)
  - any cadence Fleet 1 ship (7 candidates; cadence-substrate is
    foundational)
  - any chord Fleet 1 ship (4 candidates; chord-intent-rich is
    foundational)
  - any wintermute Fleet 1 ship (7 candidates; bootstrap+platform
    closest)
  - freshness or handshake Fleet 1 ship (1 each; both shell-target,
    fastest)
  - kernel boot (linux-wintermute pkg → grub default)
  - new user articulation OR new substrate landing in main
Without one of those, the next bare /dream should rest-pace harder:
state delta one-liner, no new gossip entry, no manifest write.

## 2026-05-26T04:00  /dream  no-fleet-pass (rest-pace, ninth)
Bare `/dream` ~14h after 2026-05-25T13:45. **Ninth /dream pass in the
arc, first post-rest.** Followed the cadence rest-pace heuristic
(banked 11:30, refined 13:45): real motion since last pass but
vision-orthogonal → log state delta + add evidence to existing
vision + skip new drafts + skip manifest write.

**State delta since 13:45 (substantive, vision-orthogonal):**
  1. `recall-daemon` v0.5.0 fully shipped end-to-end: iter-7 changelog
     2781c70 (16:25Z), iter-8 push blocked (23:36Z), iter-9 push landed
     01:05Z (range 8949d32..2781c70 — three commits f231524 + 4333b18
     + 2781c70 now on origin/main).
  2. iter-10 AC verification (01:22Z) caught a partial ship — AC1/4/6
     failed: `recall daemon start/stop/restart` subcommands never
     landed (help text claims iter-5 ships them; v0.5.0 only has
     `status`), and `recall doctor --format json` does not expose
     `daemon_active` or `daemon_uptime_s`. PRD NOT archivable until
     iter-11 closes the gap.
  3. iter-11 WIP is real but entangled: `~/wintermute/recall` working
     tree carries 4 modified files + 1 new test (`hooks/stop.sh`,
     `src/bin/recalld.rs`, `src/daemon.rs`, `src/main.rs`,
     `tests/hook_stop_session_id.rs`) — mix of recall-daemon iter-11
     scope AND sibling PRD-recall-stop-hook-session-id scope. /build
     deferred per Hard Safety Rule #5.
  4. Self-review run 8 (20:03 PT 2026-05-25) was the quietest run
     yet — confirms steady-state on most signals, escalated
     iter-11 entanglement to a /build blocker (blocker count 2→4).
  5. Kernel still stock 7.0.9. No new user articulation.

**Vision Fleet 1 counts: unchanged.** recall-daemon is build-manifest,
not vision. None of the six Fleet 2 triggers fire (continuity ≥3/5,
wintermute ≥3/7, cadence ≥1/7, chord ≥2/4, freshness ≥1/1,
handshake ≥1/1).

**One evidence-log line added (visions/chord.md §Evidence):** the
iter-10/iter-11 entanglement is the first real-world motivation for
PRD-chord-claim's soft-lock primitive. Had iter-11's originating
session claimed `repo:recall` on agorabus before editing, the
sibling stop-hook-session-id work would have backed off or queued.
Strengthens AC1+AC4 of PRD-chord-claim.md (lock acquisition +
visible holders). Not promoted to a new PRD — chord-claim already
exists, this just sharpens its motivation.

**Why no fleet drafted (rule 6):**
  - 30 PRDs across 6 visions queued; 0 Fleet 1 ships. Saturation
    is the constraint, not idea generation.
  - The new substrate (recall-daemon v0.5.0 UDS) is minimal and has
    zero downstream consumers; daemon-aware-hook PRDs would be
    "dream past the research."
  - The iter-11 entanglement motivates an *existing* PRD; no new
    PRD is warranted.

**Notes for /build:** the iter-11 working-tree state is the immediate
unblock target. Options: (a) attribute the diff to one or the other
PRD and commit the rest separately, (b) reset to HEAD and re-pick
one PRD to advance, (c) ask user. With recall-daemon's v0.5.0
shipped (commits public) but PRD un-archivable due to AC gap, the
work isn't lost — but archive is gated on iter-11 closing AC1/4/6.

Other eligible /build picks (per 13:45 list, still valid):
  - recall-outcome-feedback (rebase to v0.5.1/0.5.2/0.5.3) — does
    NOT touch the entangled files, can advance now.
  - recall-session-stamp (continuity Fleet 1, v0.6.0) — does NOT
    touch the entangled files, can advance now and would fire
    continuity Fleet 1's first ship.

**Notes for next /dream:** unblock conditions narrow again:
  - any Fleet 1 ship from any of the six visions
  - kernel boot (linux-wintermute pkg → grub default)
  - new user articulation OR new substrate landing with at least
    one downstream consumer
  - iter-11 entanglement resolution becomes a second chord-claim
    evidence line if /build records the resolution path chosen
Without one of those, next bare /dream should rest harder: terse
state delta in chat, no gossip entry, no manifest write. The
cadence-pulse PRD when it ships will codify this.

## 2026-05-26T06:20  /dream  vision-release-gate (tenth pass, FIRST DRAFT since pass 6)
Bare `/dream` ~2h20min after 2026-05-26T04:00 (ninth pass,
rest-pace). Tenth /dream pass in the arc. **First pass to draft
new artifacts since pass 6 (2026-05-25T05:25 vision-chord, 25h ago).**

**Why this pass drafted (broke the rest-pace streak):**
The cadence-rest-pace heuristic (banked 11:30 2026-05-25, refined
13:45) says rest when /build advances within an already-drafted
vision. But pass 10 saw evidence of a NEW failure mode unaddressed
by any existing PRD: the `git push origin main` gate fired AGAIN
against recall-daemon iter-15 at 2026-05-26T05:40Z — second firing
on the same PRD (first was iter-8 at 2026-05-25T23:36Z). The
publish-allowlist PRD (drafted by /build Phase 6 on 2026-05-26)
explicitly puts this case OUT OF SCOPE on line 164. The /build
iter-15 manifest entry mis-cites publish-allowlist as the fix
("Resolution path: PRD-build-publish-allowlist.md ... explicitly
targets this"), which means /build's own Phase 6 may not draft a
sibling PRD because /build believes the case is already covered.
This is the rest-pace heuristic's "new substrate with consumer"
exception inverted: NEW failure mode + WRONG resolution-path
citation in /build manifest = /dream is the closer author.

**Drafted (1 vision, 1 PRD):**
  - **visions/release-gate.md** — small vision (2 PRDs Fleet 1,
    one already queued). Frames the publish-vs-push gate pattern
    as a single class with symmetric solutions. Fleet 2 captured
    as bullets (release-gate-repos-md-sync, -prerelease, -revert)
    but explicitly NOT drafted per rule 6.
  - **PRD-build-push-allowlist.md** — `self-mod`, `build_auto:false`,
    `build_priority: high`, sibling to PRD-build-publish-allowlist.md.
    Adds `~/.local/bin/wm-push` wrapper + `Bash(wm-push:*)` allow
    rule + /build Phase 4 patch. Wrapper checks: slug regex + hard-
    coded allow-list + origin URL ends in `j0yen/<slug>` + current
    branch matches target + fast-forward only (no force-push) +
    refuses no-op. 10 ACs mirroring publish-allowlist's structure.
    Single-tick phasing, <20min estimated. Can be authorized in
    same user review pass as publish-allowlist.

**Vision Fleet 1 counts:** release-gate = 1 drafted + 1 already-
queued (publish-allowlist) = 2/2. Other six visions unchanged.
None of the prior Fleet 2 triggers fire from this pass.

**State delta since 2026-05-26T04:00 /dream pass:**
  1. recall-daemon advanced iter-11 → iter-15 (commits 36cb6ea,
     aa0922c, 3abdf7b for v0.5.2 daemon lifecycle + doctor
     liveness + changelog; all 12 ACs PASS per iter-12 smoke).
  2. recall v0.5.2 fully built + installed locally; running
     daemon still on v0.5.0 binary until restart (cosmetic).
  3. iter-15 push BLOCKED — same shape as iter-8 23:36Z. Three
     commits queued local. Archive gated on push landing
     (verified-completed Check #2 for rust-extend).
  4. iter-11 entanglement (10:00 finding on chord-vision) resolved
     trivially — the WIP attributed cleanly to recall-daemon;
     recall-stop-hook-session-id landed separately at 32590f2.
     This is the SECOND chord-claim evidence line predicted by
     the 04:00 pass. NOT promoted to PRD draft (chord-claim
     already exists, this just sharpens motivation in passing).
  5. Kernel still 7.0.10-arch1-3-wintermute (only agentns
     registered; memlog + provfs still absent — same as last
     /self-review run 9).
  6. No new user articulation.

**Freshness evidence line added:** visions/freshness.md §Evidence
log gets a new entry for the publish-vs-push mis-citation pattern.
freshness-on-prds Fleet 2 case now covers PRD-vs-PRD
cross-reference checking (not just PRD-vs-shipped-state).

**Notes for /build:**
  - **immediate**: recall-daemon iter-15 is blocked on push. Two
    paths to unblock: (a) user manually `git push origin main` from
    `~/wintermute/recall`, (b) user authorizes
    PRD-build-push-allowlist.md and PRD-build-publish-allowlist.md
    together (single review pass, both `build_priority: high`,
    single-tick phasing each, <20min combined). Path (b) is
    durable; (a) is a one-shot.
  - **don't draft a third publish-gate PRD in /build's Phase 6** —
    /dream has now drafted the sibling. release-gate vision has
    Fleet 1 complete (publish + push = 2 PRDs).
  - **update /build's iter-15 manifest entry** at next tick to
    correctly cite PRD-build-push-allowlist.md as the resolution
    path (currently cites publish-allowlist incorrectly).
  - other eligible /build picks (unchanged from 04:00 list, still
    blocked by same push-gate at their version-bump step):
    recall-outcome-feedback (v0.5.1/0.5.2/0.5.3),
    recall-session-stamp (v0.6.0). Both will hit the push gate at
    Phase 4 unless push-allowlist ships first.

**Notes for next /dream:** unblock conditions:
  - any Fleet 1 ship from any of the seven visions (now 7 with
    release-gate)
  - kernel boot WITH memlog + provfs registering (currently only
    agentns made it in; user pending investigate
    `~/wintermute/wintermute-kernel/pkg/`)
  - new user articulation OR new substrate landing with at least
    one downstream consumer
  - the chord-claim evidence count reaching 3 instances (currently
    2: iter-10/iter-11 entanglement + iter-11 resolution path)
Without one of those, next bare /dream should rest harder: terse
state delta in chat, no gossip entry, no manifest write.

**Self-application:** this pass IS a draft pass, not a rest-pace
pass, because evidence demanded it. The discipline arc holds —
nine rest-paces preceded one draft, not the other way around.

## 2026-05-27T05:30  /dream  vision-onramp (eleventh pass, second draft pass)
Bare `/dream` ~23h after 2026-05-26T06:20 (tenth pass, release-gate
draft). Eleventh /dream pass in the arc. **Second draft pass since
the discipline arc closed.**

**Why this pass drafted (Fleet 2 trigger fired):**
The rest-pace heuristic banked 13:45 names exactly this case:
"new kernel/substrate surface lands with at least one consumer."
`linux-wintermute 7.0.10-arch1-5` is BOOTED — confirmed live:
  - `uname -r` = `7.0.10-arch1-5-wintermute`
  - `cat /sys/kernel/security/lsm` includes `provfs`
  - `/dev/memlog` is a live char device (`crw-rw---- root:root 660`)
  - `/proc/self/ns/agent` exists
Consumers drafted in [continuity Fleet 1][continuity] (5 PRDs)
are the gating consumers; this is a "substrate landed with drafted
consumers" Fleet 2 fire.

Plus three empirically-observed gaps that NO existing PRD covers:
  1. `getent group memlog` returns empty (no group exists; udev
     never resolves /dev/memlog ownership)
  2. `cat /proc/self/agent_session` reads 32 zeros (no Claude
     session enters agentns; hook-time unshare is structurally
     impossible)
  3. `getfattr -d ~/wintermute/recall/Cargo.toml` returns
     `comm:awk:pid:76630:uid:1000` — provfs comm-fallback names
     the transient utility (`awk` in autobuilder pipeline), not
     the originating tool

The self-review runs 13/14/15 (2026-05-26) flagged #2 three runs
running with the wrong proposed fix ("edit agorabus-session-start.sh
to unshare"). The structural reality is that unshare is per-process
and self-only — a SessionStart hook can't enter the launched
process into a namespace post-hoc. Articulating the actual fix
(wrap the launch itself) is /dream's closer-author work.

**Drafted (1 vision, 3 PRDs):**
  - **visions/onramp.md** — small 3-PRD vision; the bridge between
    "kernel booted" and "tools consume it." Fleet 2 (5 bullets:
    agentns-launcher-hardening, memlog-readable-by-default,
    provfs-attribution-test-suite, onramp-doctor,
    kernel-pkg-postinstall-tests) explicitly NOT drafted per rule 6.
  - **PRD-kernel-pkg-postinstall.md** — `kernel-extend`, edits
    `~/wintermute/wintermute-kernel/pkg/PKGBUILD` (pkgrel 5→6),
    adds `.install` hook + sysusers.d for `memlog` group +
    udev rule for `/dev/memlog` ownership. 10 ACs (live AC10 needs
    pacman -U + reboot + login). No dependencies, ships first.
  - **PRD-claude-agentns-wrap.md** — `mixed`, edits `~/.zshrc` +
    `~/.config/systemd/user/*.service` + `agorabus-session-start.sh`.
    Three integration paths (interactive shell function, headless
    units, kernel-id-aware hook). Depends on PRD-agentns-claude.md
    being shipped + installed. 10 ACs (live AC10 needs in-session
    `/proc/self/agent_session` non-zero observation).
  - **PRD-provfs-comm-richer.md** — `kernel-extend`, pairs with
    PRD-provfs-deferred-stamp.md (shared hook-time capture buffer).
    Enriches fallback xattr value: comm chain (3 levels) + env
    signal (`CLAUDE_TOOL`, `AGORABUS_SID`) + cwd. 256-byte cap.
    agentns-present path unchanged. 10 ACs (live AC10 needs
    rebooted kernel + real workload).

**Vision Fleet 1 counts:**
  - continuity: 5 PRDs, 0 shipped (BUT 4 of 5 transitively
    blocked on PRD-claude-agentns-wrap)
  - chord: 4 PRDs, 0 shipped
  - cadence: 7 PRDs, 0 shipped
  - wintermute: 7 PRDs, 0 shipped
  - freshness: 1 PRD, 0 shipped
  - handshake: 1 PRD, 0 shipped
  - release-gate: 2 PRDs (1 drafted + 1 already-queued), 0 shipped
  - **onramp: 3 PRDs (NEW), 0 shipped**
Total: 8 visions, 30 queued PRDs (was 29 last pass + 3 new − 2 if
either of the release-gate or build-publish-allowlist PRDs ships
on a /build tick today). None of the seven Fleet 2 triggers from
prior visions fire from this pass.

**Notes for /build:**
  - **onramp-PRD-kernel-pkg-postinstall is the smallest unblock**
    (single PKGBUILD edit + 3 install assets; <30min not counting
    the kernel rebuild). User authorization needed (build_auto:false).
    Unblocks /dev/memlog usability for everyone going forward.
  - **PRD-claude-agentns-wrap depends on PRD-agentns-claude shipping
    first** ([continuity Fleet 1][continuity]); if /build picks
    continuity, PRD-agentns-claude is the natural starting point.
  - **PRD-provfs-comm-richer pairs with PRD-provfs-deferred-stamp**
    — if both ship in the same patch cycle, the kernel pkgrel
    bumps consolidate (5→6→7 becomes 5→7 in one rebuild).
  - **Eligible /build picks unchanged from yesterday's analysis:**
    recall-outcome-feedback push gate now resolved (origin/main at
    3abdf7b per iter-18); but 9 unpushed recall commits accumulated
    overnight (4 → 7 → 9) suggesting more shipped PRDs need
    archival ticks.

**Notes for next /dream:** unblock conditions narrow further now
that onramp is on the queue:
  - any Fleet 1 ship from any of the eight visions (now 8 with
    onramp; smallest path is onramp's kernel-pkg-postinstall or
    handshake's single shell-target PRD)
  - new kernel/substrate surface beyond the current 7.0.10-arch1-5
    (e.g. a memlog API extension; an agentns-counters new field)
  - new user articulation OR a NEW failure mode not covered by any
    queued PRD
  - any of the eight visions' Fleet 2 triggers firing
Without one of those, next bare /dream should rest-pace per the
discipline arc. The kernel-boot trigger is now consumed; treat
subsequent passes as steady-state until something genuinely new
arrives.

**Self-application:** this is the second draft pass since the
nine-rest-pace arc closed. The pattern holds: rest-pace nine times,
draft once when evidence demands. Discipline arc not violated;
extended.

## 2026-05-28T01:40  /dream  vision-wintermute Fleet 2 (twelfth pass, third draft pass)
Bare `/dream` ~20h after 2026-05-27T05:30 onramp draft. Twelfth /dream
pass in the arc. **Third draft pass.**

**Why this pass drafted (clear Fleet 1 ship trigger):**
The wintermute vision doc explicitly authorized Fleet 2 extend at
">=3 of 7 Fleet 1 shipped." Current shipped count per CLAUDE_SELF
changelog: 5/7 (bootstrap archived; platform/tts/stt/dialog all have
"shipped" entries; only audio + brain remain queued). The 5/7 ship
count and the explicit vision-doc trigger together fire cleanly.

Plus a new user articulation (2026-05-27): the
[always-commit-push-prds-and-work][feedback] feedback memory lands
new rules — every PRD is auto-built (build_auto stripped from new
drafts), commits + pushes are inline (no batching), no daily caps.
Dream skill instructions updated to match; this is the first draft
pass under the new defaults.

**Drafted (1 vision update, 6 PRDs):**
  - **visions/wintermute.md** updated: Fleet 1 section gains shipped
    count (5/7); Fleet 2 section converted from bullets to drafted
    table with sequencing + bumped-to-Fleet-3 list (news + glow).
  - **PRD-wintermute-browser.md** — rust-cli, `wm-browser`,
    chromiumoxide-based. Tools: open/read/click/type/back/find/
    screenshot over `wm.browser.cmd`. A11y snapshot is canonical;
    image-mode fallback via wm-screen-narrate. 10 ACs (AC10 live).
    Calls out: no Rust Playwright binding exists — vision doc's
    "Playwright" label was shorthand.
  - **PRD-wintermute-desktop.md** — rust-cli, `wm-desktop`,
    atspi-rs + xdotool via baton. Tools: apps/focus/read_window/
    click/type/key/find. Reuses j0yen/baton (shipped 2026-05-24).
    AT-SPI bus auto-enable in install.sh. 10 ACs (AC10 live).
  - **PRD-wintermute-screen-narrate.md** — rust-cli,
    `wm-screen-narrate`, scrot/grim + Claude messages API vision.
    Tools: describe/read_text/find_in_image/screenshot. Defaults
    to focused window (privacy); per-day soft budget; logs cost
    to recall. 10 ACs (AC10 live).
  - **PRD-wintermute-mail.md** — rust-cli, `wm-mail`, async-imap +
    lettre + freedesktop SecretService. Tools: inbox/read/send/
    search/mark_read/delete/folders. send + delete through
    wm-dialog verbal confirm. IMAP IDLE for new-mail signal.
    wm-bootstrap extended with /mail credential page. 10 ACs.
  - **PRD-wintermute-calendar.md** — rust-cli, `wm-cal`, minicaldav
    + ical. Tools: today/range/add/find/delete/calendars/
    set_calendar. add + delete through verbal confirm. Reminders
    via `wm.cal.event.upcoming` 5min before. wm-bootstrap /cal
    page. 10 ACs.
  - **PRD-wintermute-music.md** — rust-cli, `wm-music`, mpris-rs
    over zbus. Tools: players/play/pause/toggle/next/prev/
    now_playing/set_volume. Control-only; provider catalog/launch
    explicitly out of scope. Smallest ship in Fleet 2. 10 ACs.

**Vision Fleet 1 counts (state delta since 2026-05-27T05:30):**
  - continuity: 5 PRDs, 0 archived; PRD-agentns-claude unchanged
  - chord: 4 PRDs, 0 shipped
  - cadence: 7 PRDs, 0 shipped
  - **wintermute: 7 PRDs, 1 archived + 4 binary-shipped per
    CLAUDE_SELF → 5/7 effective. Fleet 2 NOW 6 PRDs drafted**
  - freshness: 1 PRD, 0 shipped
  - handshake: 1 PRD, 0 shipped
  - release-gate: 2 PRDs, **BOTH SHIPPED → vision fulfilled**
    (publish-allowlist + push-allowlist both in PRDs-archive/;
    also PRD-build-changelog-prepend-fix shipped as adjacent)
  - onramp: 3 PRDs, 0 shipped (substrate state unchanged:
    agent_session still zeros; memlog group still missing;
    provfs still names comm:awk for autobuilder writes)
Total: 8 visions, **36 queued PRDs** (was 30+3 onramp + 5 backlog
adds + 6 Fleet 2 new − 3 release-gate shipped = ~36; precise count
in `ls PRD-*.md` = 35 after this pass since wintermute-platform/
tts/stt/dialog still in queue dir pending archive).

**Notes for /build:**
  - **release-gate is closed** — both wrappers shipped. push +
    publish path is now durable, no longer the structural blocker
    described in 2026-05-26 gossip.
  - **wintermute Fleet 2 is six fresh queued PRDs.** Sequencing
    hint per vision update: browser/desktop are the big two
    (~1 autobuilder cycle each); music is the cheapest first ship
    (~30 min). Mail/calendar require the wm-bootstrap extension
    arm — if those are picked first, factor in the bootstrap
    side-edit. screen-narrate uses Claude vision API + cost
    budget; touch the claude-api skill on first build.
  - **Two wintermute Fleet 1 PRDs still queued + likely unshipped
    in code:** wintermute-audio + wintermute-brain. Brain is the
    capstone; audio is the perception gate for the rest of Fleet 1.
    Worth knowing if /build is choosing between Fleet 1 completion
    vs Fleet 2 starts.
  - **substrate gaps unchanged**: /dev/memlog group/udev still
    missing; agentns wrap still missing; provfs comm-fallback still
    coarse. Onramp Fleet 1 (3 PRDs from prior pass) all still
    queued.

**Notes for next /dream:** unblock conditions:
  - Any Fleet 1 ship from continuity/chord/cadence/freshness/
    handshake/onramp/wintermute (audio or brain) — five of these
    have NEVER shipped a Fleet 1 PRD; first ship for any of them
    would warrant a refresh pass.
  - Any wintermute Fleet 2 ship — would close one of the new ones
    and rebalance the queue.
  - New user articulation OR new substrate landing (kernel rebuild
    with memlog ownership rule; agentns wrap landing in a Claude
    launcher; etc.)
  - >=2 wintermute Fleet 2 ships → consider drafting Fleet 3
    (voice-profile, voice-clone, emergency, quiet-hours,
    multi-user, undo, offline-persona).

## 2026-05-27T21:35  /dream  pass 13 — Fleet 1.5
Drafted: PRD-build-deferred-acs.md
Vision: visions/wintermute.md updated with new "Fleet 1.5 — Maturation
  & validation" section (1 PRD drafted, 2 bullets for future passes:
  wm-verify, build-maturation-log).

**Trigger:** 4 wintermute Fleet 1 PRDs (platform, audio, stt, tts) all
stuck in_progress on identically-shaped hardware-dependent AC pairing
after today's publish flurry. 68 combined ticks invested across the 4
without the verified-completed check #5 gate satisfiable. Same pattern
across 4 instances = structural problem, not effortful.

**What this PRD does:** adds `deferred_acs: [N, M]` to PRD frontmatter
+ teaches /build's check #5 to honor it + writes a `Deferred:` trailer
in archive commits + backfills the 4 stuck PRDs as part of its install
action. Single tick. Sibling shape to build-publish-allowlist and
build-push-allowlist (both shipped today). `build_target: self-mod`,
`build_priority: high`.

**Notes for /build:** PRD-wintermute-dialog is one tick from archive
(iter log says "Next tick: archive PRD-wintermute-dialog.md") — that
one doesn't need this PRD. The other 4 stuck PRDs are blocked until
deferred-acs lands. After this PRD ships and backfills, expect 4
archive actions to fire in rapid succession.

**Notes for next /dream:** unblock conditions:
- build-deferred-acs ships → check that backfill actually freed the 4
  stuck PRDs; if not, the gap is more subtle than the iter logs admit
- any wintermute Fleet 2 ship → Fleet 3 draft trigger (>=2 ships)
- new user articulation
- the wm-verify Fleet 1.5 bullet reaches its own trigger (declared-
  deferred ACs exist in PRD frontmatter, motivating an attestation
  walker)


## 2026-05-27T22:00  /dream  vision-daily-receipt (pass 14, NEW vision)
Drafted: PRD-daily-receipt-summarize.md, PRD-daily-receipt-haiku.md,
  PRD-daily-receipt-stamps.md, PRD-daily-receipt-archive.md,
  PRD-daily-receipt-yearend-letter.md
Vision: visions/daily-receipt.md (new)

**Trigger:** user articulation this session — MASUNG IP1000 thermal
printer arrived 2026-05-27, PRD-daily-receipt-printer just queued
(58mm, /dev/usb/lp0 live, paper en route). User: "Articulate the
haiku-composition + year-end-scroll arc downstream of it." Vision-
worthy: 4 distinct named components + a capstone, all motivated by
the 2026-05-22 archived daily-receipt PRD's never-built §4 pipeline
and §9 open questions.

**Order (critical path):**
  1. daily-receipt-printer (THIS SESSION, queued) — bytes meet paper
  2. daily-receipt-summarize — gathers ctrace+git+recall+journal into
     summary.json; the upstream the original PRD §4 named but
     never built
  3. daily-receipt-haiku — Claude API call producing 3-line content
     from summary.json; cached system+few-shot, <$4/year
  4. daily-receipt-stamps — special-day catalog (sibling, ships any-
     time after #1; seeds itself with "printer-arrives" 2026-05-27)
  5. daily-receipt-archive — annual PDF from cadence's `daily`
     records; depends on cadence-substrate + cadence-bind-daily-
     receipt landing first
  6. daily-receipt-yearend-letter — Dec-31-23:55 long thermal strip
     + PNG twin for the archive PDF cover; depends on #5 and #3

**Notes for /build:**
  - Summarize → haiku gets workdays printing real content within
    ~3 ship cycles after the printer wrapper lands.
  - Stamps is the cheapest first ship of the 5 here (no API, no
    PDF, just JSON + render). Good "warm up" candidate.
  - Archive + yearend-letter both depend on the cadence fleet
    (substrate + bind-daily-receipt). If cadence-substrate is
    still queued when /build gets here, defer these two until it
    ships. They're well-formed PRDs regardless.
  - yearend-letter has a small rust-extend side-edit on daily-
    receipt itself (`render_long_text`). Build that crate first,
    then yearend-letter consumes it via path dep.
  - Cost ceiling for the whole arc (haiku + yearend-letter)
    estimated at <$5/year. Don't over-engineer cost controls.

**Vision doc Fleet 2 bullets (next /dream pass material):**
  - daily-receipt-photo (monthly scan-prompt ritual)
  - daily-receipt-redo (reprint a past day from cache)
  - daily-receipt-status-board (web view of the year's grid)
  - glyph vocabulary v2 (bigram-shaped, not noise — after ~30
    quiet-day strips give a feel for what's missing)
  - build-shipped milestones as automatic stamps (gossip hook)
  - K and M strips (audience-shaped haikus; multi-printer mirror)

**Notes for next /dream:** unblock conditions:
  - daily-receipt-printer ships → fix any device-quirk PRDs that
    surface (IP1000 might surprise us — paper-out detection, cut
    behavior, CP437 codepage edges, etc.)
  - Paper arrives + first real strip prints → smoke-test PRD shape
    might need revision based on real-world physical output
  - Any of summarize/haiku/stamps ships → archive + yearend-letter
    PRDs become unblock-ready (assuming cadence fleet keeps moving)
  - >=30 days of real strips accumulated → revisit glyph vocabulary
    v2, re-roll budget, and the K/M strip question with real data

## 2026-05-28T01:50  /dream  pass 14 — vision-drift
Drafted: PRD-drift-fix-self-review-dream.md, PRD-tool-manifest.md, PRD-skill-doctor.md
Vision: visions/drift.md
Order: drift-fix-self-review-dream (independent, ship first) || tool-manifest
  (no deps, ship parallel) -> skill-doctor (depends on tool-manifest)

**Seed:** Bare /dream invocation. No unblock condition from pass 13's
list was met (build-deferred-acs not shipped yet, no Fleet 2 ships, no
new user articulation, no wm-verify trigger). Looked for fresh white
space; found it: 6+ consecutive self-review ticks have flagged the same
three tool-skill drift instances in their journal entries without
resolution. Pattern is structural, not effortful — nobody owns "fix
the drifting flag." Plus a 4th instance surfaced during Phase 1
(ctrace ls in dream/SKILL.md:86, already in freshness evidence log).
All four verified live via direct probe.

**Live evidence:**
  1. `pevent gc --older-than 7d --dry-run` cited at
     `self-review/SKILL.md:74,170,389`. Installed: only `[-h]
     [--older-than OLDER_THAN]`. `--dry-run` doesn't exist; `7d`
     errors as "invalid float value: '7d'".
  2. `bpolicy status --format json` cited at `self-review/SKILL.md:77`.
     Installed `bpolicy status` accepts `[-h]` only.
  3. Bootstrap-symlinks 13-tool list at `self-review/SKILL.md:93`.
     7 of 13 missing from `~/.local/bin/`: skill, episode, apipe,
     recall-ops, recall-doctor, recall-io, mirror. Yields 7
     false-positive DANGLING lines every self-review tick.
  4. `ctrace ls` cited at `dream/SKILL.md:86`. Installed: subcommands
     are start|stop|status|query|tail. Already flagged in
     `visions/freshness.md` evidence log.

**Vision shape:** Sibling to freshness/recall-doctor-claims —
freshness catches drift in memory bodies; drift catches drift in skill
text. Same proposal-queue idiom (`~/.claude/<tool>/proposals/<ULID>.md`,
no auto-edit, user-review-gated), different data source.

**Notes for /build:**
  - drift-fix-self-review-dream is a single-tick shell-extend edit
    over two SKILL.md files. Smallest ship in vision-drift; closes
    the noise loop immediately. Verify each replacement invocation
    against the live binary BEFORE writing it.
  - tool-manifest is a fresh rust-cli, new repo at
    `~/wintermute/tool-manifest/`, new GitHub repo j0yen/tool-manifest.
    Foundational — skill-doctor reads its JSON output.
  - skill-doctor is a fresh rust-cli, new repo at
    `~/wintermute/skill-doctor/`. AC11 is the verified-completed
    gate (one user-promoted proposal must land as an actual skill
    edit), mirroring freshness/recall-doctor-claims AC10.
  - All 3 PRDs `build_auto: false` per default /dream rule (vision
    is opt-in until user articulates).

**Notes for next /dream:** unblock conditions:
  - drift-fix-self-review-dream ships → next self-review tick should
    log zero of the four flagged instances; verify in journal.
  - tool-manifest ships → skill-doctor unblocks.
  - skill-doctor ships + first user-promoted proposal lands →
    Fleet 2 draftable (drift-self-review-integration,
    drift-cli-help-snapshot, drift-changelog-witness,
    drift-config-files, drift-bootstrap-truth).
  - Any wintermute Fleet 2 ship → Fleet 3 trigger (>=2 ships).
  - build-deferred-acs ships → check Fleet 1 unblock effect.
  - New user articulation.

**Cross-fleet notes:**
  - freshness vision composes naturally: a future Fleet 2 unified-
    proposals skill could merge `recall doctor --check-claims`'s
    proposals with `skill-doctor`'s.
  - No collision with chord, cadence, continuity, handshake,
    onramp, release-gate, wintermute fleets.

## 2026-05-28T01:55  /dream  pass 14 — postscript (accidental sweep)
Commit `ac38446` (the drift-vision commit) accidentally also included
7 daily-receipt artifacts (PRD-daily-receipt-{archive,haiku,printer,
stamps,summarize,yearend-letter}.md + visions/daily-receipt.md) that
were pre-staged in the index by a parallel /dream session before I ran
my `git add`. My commit only added drift files; the daily-receipt
files were already staged from a sibling session's interrupted work
and got swept up under the wrong commit message.

No content damage — the 7 files shipped with their intended content.
But the commit message attributes them to the drift vision, which is
wrong. The sibling /dream session that authored daily-receipt should
post a follow-up gossip note correcting attribution + describing
their actual vision when they resume.

Suggested mitigation: next /dream that touches this gossip can append
the missing daily-receipt entry retroactively, or the sibling session
amends in their own pass.


## 2026-05-27T22:35  /dream  pass 15 — Fleet 1.5 expansion
Drafted: PRD-wintermute-hardware-smoke-convention.md
Vision: visions/wintermute.md updated (Fleet 1.5 §2 added)

**Trigger:** Between pass 14 (drift, 01:55Z) and this pass, two
wintermute Fleet 1 archives landed: wintermute-tts (32236d7,
2026-05-28T05:27Z) and wintermute-dialog (0a2fa94, 2026-05-28T05:08Z).
Bringing Fleet 1 to 3/7 shipped (with bootstrap). tts's archive
trailer cites pairing AC1/3/5/7 against `tests/hardware_acs.rs` —
`#[ignore]`-gated stubs that demand a `WM_TTS_HARDWARE_SMOKE=1`
witness. Verified live: the file exists at
~/wintermute/wintermute-tts/tests/hardware_acs.rs (90 lines), AC stubs
panic with instructive messages if invoked without the env var, /build's
check #5 accepted the pairing.

Pass 13's PRD-build-deferred-acs.md proposed a `deferred_acs:`
frontmatter mechanism for the same root issue. /build solved the tts
case empirically with the env-witness pattern in parallel. The two
solutions differ on whether the pairing is real (witness pattern) or
asserted via frontmatter (deferred-acs).

**What this PRD does:**
- Documents the WM_<SLUG>_HARDWARE_SMOKE convention in a new file
  `~/wintermute/autobuilder/notes/conventions/hardware-smoke.md`.
- Scaffolds `tests/hardware_acs.rs` into wintermute-platform,
  wintermute-stt, wintermute-audio matching the tts shape exactly.
- Per-PRD AC coverage: platform AC1/2/5/8, stt AC1/2/4/6/7/8, audio
  AC1/2/3/4/5/6/8.
- No skill changes, no version bumps, no binary edits. Pure test +
  docs.

**Why not retire deferred-acs:**
- Most wintermute hardware ACs are inside Rust binaries and have a
  natural cargo-test pairing surface. Witness-gating fits.
- ACs that exit Rust entirely (Gmail OAuth, install.sh as fresh
  user, printer paper-out probe) have no cargo-test pairing surface.
  deferred-acs's frontmatter is still honest for those cases.
- The two patterns coexist; ship in any order.

**Notes for /build:**
- build_target=mixed (3 rust-extend touches + 1 doc file). Single
  tick likely sufficient — total ~150 lines across 4 new files.
- /build can pick this up before OR after PRD-build-deferred-acs;
  no ordering constraint.
- After this PRD ships, the next platform/stt/audio /build tick
  should be able to mark check #5 as satisfied for the hardware-
  gated ACs and proceed to archive (modulo any remaining
  non-hardware ACs that are still genuinely failing).
- Verify the scaffolded files compile (`cargo test --release --lib`
  + `cargo test --release --test hardware_acs` 0 passed/N ignored
  for each repo) before committing per-repo.

**Notes for next /dream:** unblock conditions:
- This PRD ships → check that platform/stt/audio /build ticks
  actually advance their AC pairing (verified-completed §5
  evidence in iter logs); if not, the gap is more subtle.
- ≥2 wintermute Fleet 2 ships → Fleet 3 trigger remains (browser,
  desktop, screen-narrate, mail, calendar, music — none shipped
  yet).
- build-deferred-acs ships → still queued; check whether /build
  routed to deferred-acs or to the witness pattern for the next
  non-wintermute hardware-dep PRD that appears.
- Any of drift Fleet 1 ships (drift-fix-self-review-dream /
  tool-manifest / skill-doctor — all still queued).
- New user articulation.

**Cross-fleet notes:**
- No collision with cadence/chord/continuity/freshness/handshake/
  onramp/release-gate/daily-receipt/drift visions.
- wintermute-dialog (shipped) does NOT need backporting — its ACs
  are software-timed (barge-in measured as event-loop wall, not
  speaker-relative). Verified during draft research.
- /build's iter log for wintermute-tts is the worked example;
  /build can mirror that exactly for the three target repos.

## 2026-05-28T06:05  /dream  pass 16 — Fleet 1.5 row 3 (bus-smoke convention)
Drafted: PRD-wintermute-fleet-bus-smoke-convention.md
Vision: visions/wintermute.md updated (Fleet 1.5 row 3 added)

**Trigger:** Between pass 15 (22:35 PDT 5/27 = 05:35Z) and this pass,
an orphan PRD landed at PRD-wintermute-fleet-agorabus-announce-fix.md
(authored as /build Phase 6 follow-on during the fleet wire-up
session). It fixes a one-line-per-repo bug: wm-tts/stt/dialog/brain
each call `agorabus::Client::connect()` then immediately `.subscribe()`
without `.announce()`, hitting the daemon's `announce_required`
enforcement and exiting within ~1 s. The orphan PRD names the FIX;
this pass names the STRUCTURAL GAP that allowed it to ship undetected.

**Live evidence (verified 2026-05-27T22:55Z):**
  - agorabus/src/daemon.rs:315-316 enforces "first message must be
    Announce" (`announce_required` error + connection teardown).
  - wm-tts/src/daemon.rs:815-824 has the bug; identical shape at
    wm-stt:214,226 / wm-dialog:450,462 / wm-brain:1310,1320.
  - wm-audio/src/daemon.rs uses the CORRECT pattern; wm-audio's
    tests/wake_bus_smoke.rs:82-165 exercises it end-to-end via
    in-process agorabus::run_daemon on a temp socket.
  - wm-audio has THREE bus-smoke tests (wake/vad/reload). The other
    four repos have ZERO. None of {tts,stt,dialog,brain}/tests/ has
    a bus_smoke.rs file.
  - `cargo test --release --test wake_bus_smoke` in wm-audio passes
    in 1.4 s, no env witness needed.

**Why a 16th pass instead of a rest-pace pass:** matches the freshness
/ handshake / pass-15 single-PRD precedent. Real new evidence (orphan
PRD landed AND structural verification of the bug class confirmed
across 4 repos AND wm-audio's reference impl confirmed) PLUS a clear
shape (mirror hardware-smoke-convention exactly, but for protocol-level
wire-up instead of hardware witnessing). Not dreaming past research:
the convention file, the 4 backfill targets, the wm-audio reference,
all verified live this session.

**Why a convention rather than a typestate or a shared crate:**
typestate would be a wider agorabus API change requiring its own
research; shared crate is premature with 4 consumers and one pattern.
Convention + copy-paste skeleton is the right level today.

**Notes for /build:**
  - Ship `PRD-wintermute-fleet-agorabus-announce-fix.md` FIRST (one-
    line patch per repo, single tick across all four). Without the
    fix, the new bus_smoke.rs tests fail with announce_required —
    which is correct test behavior pre-fix, but means /build can't
    archive bus-smoke as green until the fix lands.
  - build_target=mixed (1 convention doc + 4 rust-extend touches
    across repos in the autobuilder workspace).
  - No skill changes, no version bumps, no library edits.
  - Each new bus_smoke.rs follows wake_bus_smoke.rs verbatim except
    for the daemon-under-test and the expected event topic. ~80-120
    LOC per file.
  - AC7 is the anti-cargo-cult gate: each new test must contain an
    explicit `.announce(...)` BEFORE any `.subscribe(...)` or
    `.publish(...)`. A test that connects-without-announcing
    reproduces the bug instead of catching it.

**Notes for next /dream:** unblock conditions:
  - Bus-smoke-convention ships AND announce-fix ships → next Fleet 2
    PRD draft (browser, desktop, etc.) must reference the convention
    in its acceptance criteria. /dream's drafting checklist for
    Fleet 2 needs the hook.
  - ≥2 wintermute Fleet 2 ships → Fleet 3 trigger remains (brain
    shipped per CLAUDE_SELF 2026-05-28; need one more — browser,
    desktop, screen-narrate, mail, calendar, or music).
  - Any drift Fleet 1 ship (drift-fix-self-review-dream /
    tool-manifest / skill-doctor — all still queued).
  - build-deferred-acs ships → check whether /build routes future
    hardware/process-level ACs to deferred-acs or to the
    witness/smoke patterns.
  - daily-receipt fleet ship (any of summarize / haiku / stamps /
    archive / yearend-letter).
  - New user articulation.

**Cross-fleet notes:**
  - Sibling to pass 15's hardware-smoke-convention: same structural
    shape (convention doc + scaffolded test files + no
    skill/version/binary changes), different test surface (protocol
    vs hardware), different gating (CI-runnable vs env-witness).
  - PRD-agorabus-boot-handshake (handshake vision Fleet 1) targets a
    different race (at-boot orphan subscribers in
    agorabus-session-start.sh, not in-daemon Client misuse). No
    collision; both can ship parallel.
  - Drift vision's tool-manifest + skill-doctor could grow a future
    Fleet 2 entry that flags `Client::connect` call sites missing a
    follow-up `.announce` — captured as PRD §5 out-of-scope bullet,
    not drafted this pass.
  - No collision with cadence/chord/continuity/freshness/onramp/
    release-gate/daily-receipt visions.

## 2026-05-28T06:30  /dream  pass 17 — vision-fidelity (NEW vision)
Drafted:
  PRD-recall-surfaced-tracking.md      (v0.7.1)
  PRD-recall-use-evidence.md           (v0.7.2)
  PRD-recall-stop-hook-discriminate.md (v0.7.3) ← load-bearing
  PRD-recall-doctor-utility.md         (v0.7.4)
  PRD-recall-corpus-vacuum.md          (v0.7.5)
Vision: visions/fidelity.md

**Seed:** reflective sweep. recall-outcome-feedback shipped 2026-05-27
acknowledged the gap explicitly ("memories that consistently help drift
up") but its implementation can only detect "no contradiction" — not
"actually used." The Stop hook reads `~/.cache/recall-weather/<sid>/
recalled.json` and applies blanket `+0.02` accept on every surfaced id.

**Live evidence (verified 2026-05-28T06:11Z):**
  - 158 weather session dirs accumulated under
    `~/.cache/recall-weather/` — each was a blanket-accept fire.
  - `~/.claude/scripts/recall-stop.sh` lines 39-50 contain the
    blanket-accept block (jq -r .[]? then `recall feedback --accept`).
  - First fire of recall-search-inject (2026-05-28T05:35Z) surfaced 5
    memories; only the self-referential one was actually used. Other 4
    got the same reward.
  - `src/index.rs` has feedback_count + recall_count but NOT
    surfaced_count or used_count — the columns must be added.

**Why this vision now:**
  - recall-outcome-feedback just shipped (v0.6.0, 2026-05-27).
    Fidelity is the natural v2 — refines the signal it created.
  - wintermute-brain shipped 2026-05-28 — its quality is gated by
    recall ranking, and the brain will compound any bias faster than
    human-paced sessions did.
  - The queue is already big; targeting v0.7.x means no version
    collision with shipped work or recall-doctor-claims (v0.7.0
    reservation).

**Order (load-bearing notes for /build):**
  - recall-surfaced-tracking (v0.7.1) is pure data plumbing — no
    behavior change. Schema migration + new feedback flag + hook
    writes. Smallest first; nothing else depends on PRD #2-5 until
    this lands.
  - recall-use-evidence (v0.7.2) is transcript scanning — new module,
    new subcommand, no behavior change. Independent of #1 except for
    consuming surfaced.json that #1 writes.
  - recall-stop-hook-discriminate (v0.7.3) is THE behavior change.
    Don't ship #4 or #5 without it or the metrics will be misleading
    (no used_count data accumulating).
  - recall-doctor-utility (v0.7.4) is purely diagnostic — extends
    doctor with utility section. Safe to ship anytime after #3.
  - recall-corpus-vacuum (v0.7.5) is the action layer — sweep that
    decays / supersede-proposes / archives noise memories. Ships last.

**Cross-vision notes:**
  - Companion to `recall-outcome-feedback` (archived). Fidelity is
    its v2.
  - Adjacent to `freshness` (PRD-recall-doctor-claims v0.7.0). Both
    extend doctor; different sections; no collision.
  - Feeds `wintermute-brain` (shipped) — better ranking calibration
    means better brain answers.
  - No collision with cadence/chord/continuity/drift/daily-receipt/
    wintermute/release-gate/handshake/onramp visions.

**Notes for /build:**
  - All 5 PRDs use build_target=rust-extend into ~/wintermute/recall.
    Same pattern as recall-daemon, recall-outcome-feedback,
    recall-observer-correlation that already shipped.
  - First two PRDs are tightly scoped (one migration + one column
    each; one new module each). 1-2 iters per PRD expected.
  - Test fixtures in PRD ACs are designed to be writable as unit
    tests inside the existing recall test suite — no new test
    infrastructure needed.
  - PRD #2 (recall-use-evidence) adds a transcript-scan dependency on
    `~/.claude/projects/-home-jsy/<uuid>.jsonl` — verify AC1 (path
    mapping) before doing more work. If the mapping is wrong the rest
    of the PRD degrades to no-op (abstain-on-everything), which is
    safe but defeats the purpose.
  - PRD #3 (discriminate) carries a legacy-fallback path so weather
    dirs from before PRD #1 keep working. AC5 verifies the fallback.

**Open questions (also in vision §Open questions):**
  - Cost of transcript scan in Stop hook latency — measured at <500ms
    target (AC7 of PRD #2); gated by config flag default-off in
    v0.7.2, default-on after measurement.
  - Use-evidence false negatives from paraphrase — accepted; abstain
    is no-op, so false-negative doesn't penalize (unlike
    false-positive which doesn't exist by construction).
  - Should `used_count` feed ranking weights directly? — out of scope
    for v0.7.x; ranking pulls confidence which already reflects
    discrimination. v2 idea.

**Notes for next /dream:**
  - Once PRDs #1-3 ship, check if the existing 158 weather session
    dirs created drift worth recomputing. If yes, draft
    PRD-recall-confidence-recalibrate that re-evaluates each memory's
    confidence against post-v0.7.3 utility data.
  - If the brain's recall layer ends up needing query-time
    `used_count` ranking input (v2 idea above), draft
    PRD-recall-ranking-utility-weight as Fleet 2 of fidelity.
  - Cross-fleet trigger: if /build's Phase 6 generates a follow-on
    PRD that touches the same code paths (e.g., recall-stop-hook
    refactor), flag for collision review before drafting more
    fidelity work.

## 2026-05-28T07:05  /dream  no-fleet-pass (curation + boot validated)

Bare /dream ~30min after fidelity vision drop. Eighth no-fleet-pass.
Curation, not drafting — research didn't motivate a new fleet.

**Boot validation landed this pass** (was an open gate for continuity vision):
  - `uname -r` → `7.0.10-arch1-5-wintermute` (linux-wintermute booted)
  - `/dev/memlog` is a live char device
  - `cat /proc/self/agent_session` → 32 zeros (kernel surface present;
    Claude is NOT yet wrapped — confirms `claude-agentns-wrap` is the
    highest-leverage unblock for the continuity arc)
  - `pacman -Q linux-wintermute` → `7.0.10.arch1-5`

**Curation actions** (no PRD content changed, only manifest):
  - Attached `PRD-provfs-deferred-stamp.md` to `onramp` Fleet 1
    prds_drafted. Already cited by name in vision doc §Order #3 ("pairs
    with provfs-comm-richer, shared hook-time capture buffer"); the
    manifest list had omitted it. Now consistent.
  - Attached `PRD-wintermute-fleet-agorabus-announce-fix.md` to
    `wintermute` Fleet 1.5 prds_drafted. Already cited verbatim in the
    fleet_1_5_pass_16_trigger note (one-line-per-repo `Client::announce()`
    fix; sibling to bus-smoke-convention); manifest list had omitted it.
  - Added `boot_validated_at` + evidence to continuity manifest entry.

**No new PRDs drafted.** Considered four candidates that look like a
"continuity Fleet 1.5" (claude-agentns-wrap, kernel-pkg-postinstall,
provfs-comm-richer, provfs-deferred-stamp), then re-read the onramp
vision and found they ARE that fleet by other name. Drafting a wrapper
would duplicate intent. Per dream rule 6 ("don't dream past the
research"), curation is the honest output here.

**Hints for /build:**
  - `onramp` Fleet 1 #2 (`PRD-claude-agentns-wrap.md`) is now the
    highest-leverage unblock — it gates 4 of 5 `continuity` Fleet 1
    PRDs (recall-session-stamp/memlog-witness/session-postmortem/provq
    all need non-zero `agent_session`). Until this lands every Claude
    session continues to read 32 zeros and the rest of continuity
    silently falls back to PID-tree / `comm:` mode.
  - `onramp` Fleet 1 #1 (`PRD-kernel-pkg-postinstall.md`) is the
    smallest and has no deps. After it ships, `memlog show` works
    without sudo for users in the new `memlog` group.
  - `fidelity` Fleet 1 (5 PRDs, drafted at 06:30Z this morning) is
    ready for pickup; PRD-recall-surfaced-tracking is the lead (pure
    data plumbing, smallest first).

**Inventory snapshot:**
  - 56 PRDs on disk, 47 attached to visions, 9 unattached.
  - Of the 9 unattached: 5 shipped per CLAUDE_SELF changelog (ambient,
    cradle, cradle-bake-integration, morsel, daily-receipt-printer —
    the last one lives intentionally in daily-receipt's
    prds_referenced_not_drafted), 3 are notebook seeds (serious-200,
    whimsy-50, whimsy-cont — `build_target: notebook`, not vision
    material), 1 is the agorabus-announce-fix attached this pass.
  - 12 active visions; 1 fulfilled (release-gate).

**Notes for next /dream:** Trigger to break a no-fleet streak should
be one of: (a) `claude-agentns-wrap` ships and a Claude session reads
a non-zero `agent_session` for the first time — that's the kernel→
userspace handshake fully landed and Fleet 2 of continuity becomes
draftable; (b) fidelity Fleet 1 reaches ≥3 of 5 shipped — Fleet 2
(confidence-recalibrate, ranking-utility-weight) becomes evidence-
backed; (c) new user articulation.

## 2026-05-28T07:30  /dream  no-fleet-pass (state delta logged, triggers still unmet)

Bare /dream 25min after 07:05Z. NINTH /dream no-fleet-pass. State delta
since 07:05Z (small but real, all from /build motion):

  - PRD-wintermute-platform archived (autobuilder commit 139f0a6 at
    07:15Z, status: shipped, 15 ticks). Was already counted as a
    wintermute Fleet 1 ship at 01:40Z (`fleet_2_trigger` note); archive
    closes the bookkeeping without firing a new trigger.
  - wintermute-brain advanced iter-19 → iter-20 (in_progress, last
    07:22Z). CLAUDE_SELF says it shipped on GitHub today; the build
    manifest's in_progress reflects pending archive, not pending code.
  - `~/.cache/recall-weather/` 158 → 173 dirs in 79min (~11/hour
    bias-accumulation rate). Steady; matches the rate fidelity Fleet 1
    PRD #1 (recall-surfaced-tracking) is designed to instrument.
  - /proc/self/agent_session: still 32 zeros. claude-agentns-wrap
    queued; no progress.

Triggers from 07:05Z (still unmet):
  (a) claude-agentns-wrap ships → queued, ticks=0. UNMET.
  (b) fidelity Fleet 1 ≥3/5 shipped → 0/5 (all queued, ticks=0). UNMET.
  (c) new user articulation → bare /dream this pass. UNMET.

Curation considered, none warranted:
  - Inventory: 8 unattached PRDs (5 shipped+stale + 3 notebook seeds).
    Down from 9 at 07:05Z because that pass attached agorabus-announce-
    fix. All 8 explained per 07:05Z gossip note; no relabeling needed.
  - `~/.claude/scripts/recall-search-inject.sh` exists as a UserPromptSubmit
    hook with no PRD provenance (sibling to the v0.6.0 outcome-feedback
    Stop hook). Drafting a backfill PRD now would be paperwork — it's
    plumbing, not a new feature, and fidelity Fleet 1 #1 will instrument
    it via the surfaced-tracking schema. Logged here for trace.
  - dream manifest `_no_fleet_passes` array sits under `.visions` (mixed
    object+array siblings under one key). Confused my reconcile-query
    once this pass; the `?` operator in jq doesn't suppress the
    "indexing array with string" error so queries need
    `select(.value | type == "object")` first. Not a bug worth a PRD;
    just a query-author footgun. Worth a one-line note in dream/SKILL.md
    on the next skill edit. Not edited this pass.

No PRDs drafted. Per rule 6 — don't dream past the research; rule from
11:30Z 5/25 — if state is essentially unchanged AND no trigger fires,
prefer skip-writes; but the platform archive + brain motion + weather
rate are worth logging in the no-fleet-pass record so the next /dream
sees them. Sticking with terse gossip + manifest update; no PRD churn.

Notes for next /dream:
  - Same triggers as 07:05Z: agentns-wrap ship, fidelity ≥3/5, or new
    articulation.
  - Watch wintermute-brain archive (status: in_progress → shipped).
    Doesn't fire a new trigger (already counted), but closes the
    wintermute Fleet 1 archival arc.
  - Watch /build pickup of fidelity Fleet 1 — recall-surfaced-tracking
    is the lead (smallest, pure data-plumbing, no deps).

## 2026-05-28T08:05  /dream  vision-harvest

Drafted: PRD-learning-candidate-triage.md, PRD-learning-candidate-prefilter.md, PRD-learning-candidate-prune.md
Vision: visions/harvest.md
Order: triage → prefilter → prune (no hard deps, but triage defines the
  consumer surface so it's the most useful pickup first; prefilter tunes
  the producer once we have one real consumption cycle of data; prune is
  smallest and most mechanical, can ship any time).

**Trigger.** None of the 07:30Z triggers met (agentns-wrap unshipped,
fidelity Fleet 1 0/5 shipped, bare /dream). But Phase 1 surfaced a new
gap not previously catalogued: 3 learning-candidate drafts in
`~/.claude/scratch/learning-candidates/` with zero consumer. The Stop
hook (`recall-learning-candidate.sh`) and SessionStart hook
(`learning-candidates-start.sh`) ship signal that nothing harvests.
`grep learning-candidate ~/wintermute/autobuilder/*.md visions/*.md` →
zero hits before this pass. Real gap, not paperwork.

**Distinction from prior notes.** The 07:30Z gossip explicitly declined
to draft a backfill PRD for `recall-search-inject.sh` because "fidelity
Fleet 1 #1 will instrument it." That argument doesn't apply here:
fidelity Fleet 1 is about *surface-vs-use* discrimination in recall
ranking, NOT about consuming the candidate-draft queue. No PRD anywhere
covers the draft pipeline's consumer side.

**Notes for /build:**
  - All three PRDs are shell/skill targets — no Rust, no `/autobuilder`
    cycle. Build path is direct (write the script/skill file, smoke-test,
    commit).
  - Triage is the lead: largest LOC, defines the consumer surface.
  - Prefilter's AC1 specifies a *more conservative* threshold than today's
    behavior — the existing single-match drafts will continue working
    through triage; only future emissions are affected. No backwards-
    compatibility risk to today's queue.
  - Prune ships the *script* but **not** any timer wiring or
    /self-review hook (out of scope, follow-up after manual proving).
  - Drafts themselves are already on disk; triage can be smoke-tested
    against them as soon as the skill exists. No artificial setup needed.

**Open questions (also in vision):**
  - Should SessionStart's `learning-candidates-start.sh` stop verbatim-
    surfacing drafts after triage exists, and instead nudge `/triage`?
    Left for the triage PRD to decide.
  - Auto-promote (skip-review on highest-confidence drafts) — captured
    as stretch in vision; defer to successor PRD-learning-candidate-
    auto-promote if practice shows it's worth.

**Notes for next /dream:**
  - Trigger to revisit harvest: triage ships AND processes ≥10 real
    drafts → data exists to tune prefilter thresholds with evidence
    instead of guessing.
  - Carry-forward triggers from 07:30Z still apply: claude-agentns-wrap
    ship, fidelity Fleet 1 ≥3/5 shipped, new user articulation.
  - Inventory delta: 54 PRDs → 57 PRDs after this pass; 12 active
    visions → 13.

## 2026-05-28T08:30  /dream  no-fleet-pass (post-harvest cooldown)

Bare /dream 25min after vision-harvest drop. TENTH /dream no-fleet-pass
overall. State delta since 08:05Z (small, all expected):

  - wintermute-brain archived (autobuilder commit 3f66aac).
    Closes the wintermute Fleet 1 archival arc that 07:30Z gossip
    flagged for watch. Already counted in pass 13's Fleet 2 trigger;
    archive doesn't fire a new one.
  - ~/.cache/recall-weather/ 173 → 193 dirs in ~60min (~20/h, up from
    the 11/h baseline at 07:30Z). Burst is from this session's heavy
    recall-query phase; fidelity Fleet 1 #1 is still the right
    instrumentation, no action needed.
  - 3 learning-candidate drafts unchanged in queue. harvest just
    landed 25min ago; /build pickup hasn't fired yet. Appropriate.
  - /proc/self/agent_session: still 32 zeros. claude-agentns-wrap
    queued, ticks=0. UNMET.

Triggers from 08:05Z (still unmet):
  (a) claude-agentns-wrap ships → UNMET.
  (b) fidelity Fleet 1 ≥3/5 shipped → 0/5. UNMET.
  (c) new user articulation → bare /dream. UNMET.
  (d) harvest triage ships AND ≥10 real drafts processed → UNMET
      (3 drafts on disk; triage queued, ticks=0).

No PRDs drafted. Per rule 6 — don't dream past the research; per
the rest-pace pattern (passes 5-11 of the 5/25 arc) — if state is
essentially unchanged AND no trigger fires, prefer terse log over
PRD churn. State *is* essentially unchanged from 25min ago.

Curation considered, none warranted:
  - Inventory unchanged: 57 PRDs on disk, 50 attached to visions
    (harvest's 3 added at 08:05Z), 7 unattached (5 shipped+stale +
    3 notebook seeds; agorabus-announce-fix attached 07:05Z).
  - 13 active visions. drift verified live; nothing new to attach.

Notes for next /dream:
  - Same four triggers carry forward.
  - Watch /build pickup of harvest's triage PRD (smallest of the
    three, defines consumer surface — appropriate first pickup).
  - Watch fidelity Fleet 1 #1 (recall-surfaced-tracking) — pure
    data plumbing, no deps, smallest first. The 20/h weather burst
    is the kind of data this PRD is designed to expose.

## 2026-05-28T09:30  /dream  no-fleet-pass (harvest 1/3 shipped delta)

Timer-cadence /dream 57min after 08:33Z pass-10 commit. ELEVENTH
/dream no-fleet-pass. State delta since 08:33Z is small but contains
the first real harvest-fleet ship:

  - **PRD-learning-candidate-prefilter SHIPPED + archived** at 08:45Z
    (autobuilder 4280bb9, 12min after 08:33Z gossip). Harvest fleet
    now 1/3 shipped. Audit log
    `~/.claude/scratch/learning-candidates/.audit.log` shows 6 smoke
    rows at 08:34-08:35Z exercising score thresholds + dup detection;
    classifications look correct. Real-world signal still pending —
    no Stop hook has emitted a real draft since prefilter went live
    (latest real draft is 01:35 PDT = 08:35Z, smoke tests run shortly
    after at 08:34Z timestamps). First post-ship session-end will be
    the empirical evidence point.
  - wintermute-hardware-smoke convention picked up iter-3 docs
    (autobuilder da767c8 at ~08:50Z) — Fleet 1.5 motion continues.
  - wintermute-brain archived (autobuilder 3f66aac at 08:30:58Z) —
    already counted in pass-13/Fleet-2 trigger; archive closes the
    bookkeeping.
  - 3 learning-candidate drafts unchanged in queue (3 files; latest
    01:35 PDT = 08:35Z). Triage in_progress ticks=1; not yet ready
    to consume them.
  - /proc/self/agent_session: 32 zeros. claude-agentns-wrap queued
    ticks=0. UNMET.

Triggers from 08:30Z (still unmet):
  (a) claude-agentns-wrap ships → UNMET (queued, ticks=0).
  (b) fidelity Fleet 1 ≥3/5 shipped → 0/5 (all queued, ticks=0).
  (c) new user articulation → bare /dream this pass.
  (d) harvest triage ships AND ≥10 drafts processed → triage
      in_progress ticks=1; 3 drafts on disk; UNMET on both counts.

**Curation this pass:** harvest manifest entry updated with
`prefilter_shipped_at: 2026-05-28T08:45:07Z` + audit evidence pointer +
`pass_11_curation` note. Mechanical bookkeeping; no PRD content
changed.

No PRDs drafted. Per rule 6 — don't dream past the research; per the
rest-pace pattern — if state delta is consumable in one bookkeeping
line and no trigger fires, prefer terse log + manifest curation over
PRD churn. The harvest fleet ship is a healthy data point but doesn't
itself motivate a new vision (the existing triage + prune PRDs are
the right next moves, both already drafted).

Working-tree note (NOT this pass's responsibility): three untracked
files in `~/wintermute/autobuilder/` belong to in-flight /build work:
`.run-ambient/` (ambient-compositions notebook), `intent-cards/
confidant.intent-card.json` (cadence/chord scratch), `notes/
conventions/hardware-smoke.md` (Fleet 1.5 convention doc). /build to
commit when ready; this commit stages only gossip + dream manifest.

Notes for next /dream:
  - Same four triggers carry forward.
  - **Watch harvest triage ship** — that gives us first real
    consumer-side data. The 3 stale drafts (still surfacing in every
    fresh session's banner) are the canonical regression test.
  - **Watch first real post-prefilter Stop hook emit** — the audit
    log will show the score + decision; if a session that previously
    would have emitted 1-3 noise drafts now emits 0 or 1 high-score
    draft, prefilter's working as designed.
  - **Watch fidelity Fleet 1 first ship** (recall-surfaced-tracking
    smallest) — pure data plumbing, no deps, fires trigger (b)
    progress.

## 2026-05-28T10:00  /dream  no-fleet-pass (12th; triage progress, LC queue dropped)

Bare /dream ~30min after 09:30Z pass-11. TWELFTH /dream no-fleet-pass.
State delta since 09:30Z is digestible-as-bookkeeping:

  - **harvest triage progress**: ticks 1 → 2, status still in_progress
    (not shipped). One /build tick happened against it between 09:30Z
    and 10:00Z. Lead PRD still hasn't landed.
  - **LC queue dropped 3 → 0 drafts**. .audit.log mtime unchanged
    (08:35Z smoke entries); directory mtime advanced to 09:34Z. Three
    real drafts that surfaced in every fresh SessionStart banner since
    08:30Z are no longer on disk. Mechanism not directly observable
    from this pass — most likely candidates: (i) /build's triage tick
    at ticks=2 consumed them as part of the consumer-side smoke prove,
    (ii) prune script (which is queued, ticks=0 per manifest — so this
    is unlikely), or (iii) the user manually invoked /triage. **Worth
    a watch in next /dream**: if drafts disappear without /triage
    audit-log entries, the consumption path is silent — that's a
    different observability gap than the existing harvest PRDs cover.
  - **agentns userspace in-flight**: `~/wintermute/agentns/` has 5
    modified files + `userspace/` untracked dir + `tests/
    unshare-helper.c` untracked, no new commits since f5b24e0. Run-9
    self-review (~02:00Z) noted "1 commit ahead" but local repo shows
    no unpushed commits this pass; either the commit got pushed
    between runs or run-9's count came from a stale snapshot. Either
    way, claude-agentns-wrap PRD is *finally* under active
    implementation — first time since it was drafted.
  - **No new autobuilder commits** between 09:30Z and 10:00Z (only
    b3da338 = pass-11 gossip). /build hasn't ticked anything else
    forward in 30 min.
  - **No new real drafts since 08:35Z** (.audit.log last entries are
    smoke tests from prefilter ship + the duplicate-detect smoke).
    First post-ship real-draft empirical evidence still pending.
  - /proc/self/agent_session: 32 zeros. UNMET.

Triggers from 09:30Z (still ALL unmet):
  (a) claude-agentns-wrap ships → UNMET (queued, ticks=0; userspace
      work in flight but not committed; PRD-claude-agentns-wrap.md
      from onramp vision is the load-bearing piece).
  (b) fidelity Fleet 1 ≥3/5 shipped → 0/5 UNMET (all queued ticks=0).
  (c) new user articulation → bare /dream this pass. UNMET.
  (d) harvest triage ships AND ≥10 drafts processed → UNMET on both
      counts (triage ticks=2 in_progress; 0 drafts on disk so the
      ≥10 condition is *further* from satisfaction than at 09:30Z).

No PRDs drafted. Per rule 6 — don't dream past the research; per the
rest-pace pattern (passes 5-11 of the 5/25 arc and now 10/11/12 of the
5/28 arc) — when state delta is digestible as bookkeeping and no
trigger fires, prefer terse log over PRD churn. The triage progress
tick and the unobserved LC queue drain are real signals but neither
motivates a new vision: triage is *the* consumer being built; the
queue drain mechanism is a watch-item for next /dream, not a PRD.

Curation considered, none warranted:
  - Inventory unchanged: 57 PRDs on disk, 50 attached to visions, 7
    unattached (5 shipped+stale + 3 notebook seeds; agorabus-announce-
    fix attached at 07:05Z this morning).
  - 13 active visions; nothing new to attach.
  - Self-review run-9 surfaced the 9th-consecutive `recall divergence
    false-trigger` flag with explicit cost: "Has not been worth fixing
    7 times in a row, but it's noise on every run now." A one-line
    skill patch (exclude `recall/proposals/*.md` from file-count) or
    a recall-side move would close it. Considered drafting a single-
    PRD vision for /self-review noise reduction — declined this pass.
    Reasons: (i) the fix is genuinely a 30-second mechanical patch,
    not PRD-shaped work; (ii) freshness Fleet 2 has a
    `freshness-on-recall` bullet that could naturally swallow it when
    Fleet 1 ships; (iii) the user has the most efficient path
    (`txn-edit` the skill template, two minutes). Logged here for
    trace; if it shows up a 10th time, draft a one-line PRD then.

Notes for next /dream:
  - Same four triggers carry forward unchanged.
  - **Watch LC queue mechanism**: if drafts disappear again without
    corresponding .audit.log entries, that's a real observability gap
    — possibly draft PRD-learning-candidate-audit-completeness as a
    successor to harvest's triage. Hold this pass; gather one more
    data point first.
  - **Watch claude-agentns-wrap implementation**: agentns userspace/
    dir is now active work. First time the trigger (a) PRD is
    moving. If a commit lands and userspace registration produces a
    non-zero `/proc/self/agent_session`, that's a vision-grade event
    — onramp Fleet 1 will be partly fulfilled and continuity Fleet 1
    becomes unblocked (5 PRDs all depending on it).
  - **Watch fidelity Fleet 1 #1 first ship** (recall-surfaced-tracking,
    smallest, no deps). Still 0/5 shipped after 24+ hours since drop.

## 2026-05-28T10:30  /dream  no-fleet-pass (13th; Fleet 1.5 ship + LC mystery resolved)

Bare /dream ~30min after 10:00Z pass-12. THIRTEENTH /dream no-fleet-pass.
State delta is digestible-as-bookkeeping, but with one mystery closed.

State delta since 10:00Z:

  - **5 new autobuilder commits**, all within already-shipping work:
    - **274c9b4** `build: archive PRD-wintermute-hardware-smoke-convention
      (shipped)` — wintermute Fleet 1.5 PRD SHIPPED. Already counted
      under fleet_1_5_pass_15 trigger; doesn't fire a new Fleet 2
      trigger because it's NOT a fidelity Fleet 1 ship (trigger (b)
      still 0/5).
    - **8a759bc / f8d9c09 / b077a1f / 52e0315** — build-deferred-acs
      iter-5 backfill across wintermute-platform/audio/stt/tts.
      Mechanical fan-out of the convention shipped at 274c9b4;
      build-deferred-acs PRD still in_progress (this is its job).

  - **LC queue mystery from pass 12 → RESOLVED.** Self-review run 9
    at 09:34Z explicitly logs:
      `## Triage — 2026-05-28T09:34Z (one /build tick → /triage)`
    with 3 candidate dispositions (1 save → procedural/self memory
    01KSPYXA03FFGFQ2G1Z6AYQDEJ "use recall + skills proactively",
    2 discard — one dup of the save, one machine-output false-match).
    Consumption mechanism IS audit-logged, just in journal not in
    `.claude/scratch/learning-candidates/.audit.log`. No
    observability gap; pass-12 hypothesis of drafting
    PRD-learning-candidate-audit-completeness is REJECTED.

  - **agentns userspace work continues in flight**: still
    `~/wintermute/agentns/userspace/` untracked + 5 modified files +
    tests/unshare-helper.c untracked, no new commits since
    a8a1845. claude-agentns-wrap PRD ticks=0 in manifest. First
    commit-grade artifact still pending.

  - **/build blocker count rose 3 → 5** per self-review runs 8→9:
    added `chord-async-delegate` (user-gate-install) +
    `drift-fix-self-review-dream` (classifier-self-mod). All 5 need
    user judgment, none auto-clearable.

  - **New finding from self-review run 9 /triage section**: `/triage`
    SKILL.md classification table maps `--kind feedback` but recall
    REJECTS that kind (valid: procedural/semantic/episodic/reflective).
    Self-review used `procedural/self` as nearest fit. This is a
    real bug in `~/.claude/skills/triage/SKILL.md`. **Logged here,
    not drafted** — same logic as pass-12 self-review noise
    reduction: 30-second mechanical patch, not PRD-shaped, and the
    in_progress PRD-learning-candidate-triage.md could naturally
    swallow it as an additional AC. If it recurs across passes,
    revisit.

  - /proc/self/agent_session: 32 zeros. UNMET.

Triggers from 10:00Z (still ALL unmet):
  (a) claude-agentns-wrap ships → UNMET (queued, ticks=0; userspace
      work in flight but not committed).
  (b) fidelity Fleet 1 ≥3/5 shipped → 0/5 UNMET (all queued
      ticks=0; 274c9b4 is wintermute Fleet 1.5, not fidelity).
  (c) new user articulation → bare /dream this pass. UNMET.
  (d) harvest triage ships AND ≥10 drafts processed → triage
      in_progress ticks unchanged; 0 drafts on disk so ≥10 condition
      is FURTHER from satisfaction. UNMET on both counts.

No PRDs drafted. Per rule 6 — don't dream past the research; per
the rest-pace pattern (now 12/13 of the 5/28 arc) — when state delta
is digestible as bookkeeping and no trigger fires, prefer terse log
over PRD churn. The Fleet 1.5 ship is a healthy data point but was
already counted in the fleet_1_5_pass_15 trigger. The LC mystery
closing is the most valuable finding — it prevents drafting a
duplicate observability PRD.

Curation considered, none warranted:
  - Inventory unchanged: 57 PRDs on disk, 50 attached to visions,
    7 unattached (5 shipped+stale + 3 notebook seeds; all explained
    in prior passes).
  - 13 active visions; nothing new to attach.
  - The triage `--kind feedback` bug could be a one-line addition
    to PRD-learning-candidate-triage.md but rule 2 ("never modify
    existing PRDs") suggests waiting for /build to take a tick on
    it and surface the issue from inside the implementation pass.

Notes for next /dream:
  - Same four triggers carry forward unchanged.
  - **Watch claude-agentns-wrap commit**: agentns userspace dir
    has been "active in flight" for two passes now without a
    commit-grade artifact. If 30+ min passes without progress,
    that's a stall signal worth noting (not a PRD; just a watch).
  - **Watch /triage skill recurrence**: if a future self-review run
    independently surfaces the `--kind feedback` bug a second time,
    it's worth a one-line PRD then.
  - **Watch fidelity Fleet 1 first ship** (recall-surfaced-tracking,
    smallest, no deps). 0/5 after ~28 hours since drop.
  - **Watch chord-async-delegate / drift-fix-self-review-dream**:
    both `in_progress ticks=0`. They're blocked on classifier/user-
    gate, not on /build inertia. User-flip might be all they need.

## 2026-05-28T11:00  /dream  no-fleet-pass (14th; harvest Fleet 1 fulfilled, agentns still uncommitted)

Bare /dream ~30min after 10:30Z pass-13. FOURTEENTH /dream no-fleet-pass.
One curation this pass: harvest vision flipped active→fulfilled.

State delta since 10:30Z:

  - **2 new autobuilder commits, both archival**: 0999a07 archives
    PRD-learning-candidate-triage (shipped) + df88b74 archives
    PRD-learning-candidate-prune (shipped). With prefilter shipped
    earlier today (08:45Z), **harvest Fleet 1 is now 3/3 → vision
    fulfilled**. Updated manifest: visions.harvest.status
    active→fulfilled, fulfilled_at=2026-05-28T11:00:00Z, added a
    pass_14_curation note. Eighth vision overall to reach fulfilled
    (joining release-gate at pass 11).
  - **agentns userspace work continues in flight, third pass without
    a commit**: `~/wintermute/agentns/userspace/` has `agent-wrap.c`
    (87 LOC, complete CLONE_NEWAGENT unshare wrapper with AGENT_INTENT
    prctl handling; gracefully degrades to plain exec on ENOSYS/EPERM
    with clear stderr; needs setcap cap_sys_admin+ep on installed
    binary) plus a Makefile (gcc -O2 -Wall -Wextra -std=gnu11 -I..,
    builds against ../include/uapi/linux/agent_namespaces.h). Both
    files readable on disk, both untracked. No new commits in
    ~/wintermute/agentns/ since a8a1845 (the kernel-side boot-hang
    fix). Same shape as passes 12 + 13 — readable, complete-looking,
    uncommitted. THREE consecutive passes now.
  - **/proc/self/agent_session still 32 zeros** (kernel surface
    unchanged; claude wrapping still the load-bearing gap).
  - **recall reflective queue**: latest 10 reflective/self memories
    all recalls=0 (consistent with self-review run 9's "8 stale
    reflective entries >30d" finding; pattern persists). Not a
    drafting trigger by itself but a continuing freshness signal.

Triggers from 10:30Z:
  (a) claude-agentns-wrap ships → UNMET (queued, ticks=0; agent-wrap.c
      readable but uncommitted does not count as a Fleet 1 ship).
  (b) fidelity Fleet 1 ≥3/5 shipped → 0/5 UNMET.
  (c) new user articulation → bare /dream. UNMET.
  (d) harvest triage ships + ≥10 drafts processed → **FIRST HALF MET**
      (triage shipped at 0999a07). **SECOND HALF UNMET** (LC queue
      at 0 drafts; consumer has not been exercised against post-
      prefilter real production). Conjunction fails. Trigger (d)
      does not fire because we have no empirical Fleet 2 signal
      from "actually consumed live drafts" yet.

No PRDs drafted this pass. Per rule 6: harvest Fleet 2 needs Fleet 1
to have been *used*, not just *shipped*. Triage at ticks=0-against-
real-drafts is shipped-but-unvalidated. Fleet 2 bullets in vision doc
stay as bullets. Curation considered, none warranted beyond marking
harvest fulfilled: 57 PRDs unchanged; 12 active visions + 1 newly
fulfilled (harvest); nothing else needing reattachment.

Watch items carrying forward:
  - **claude-agentns-wrap commit**: third pass in flight without a
    commit. The work is complete enough on disk to compile and run;
    what's missing is just `cd ~/wintermute/agentns && git add
    userspace/ && git commit && git push` plus an install step. If
    a fourth pass still shows uncommitted state, that's worth a
    user nudge — not a PRD, just an offer ("the agentns userspace
    work has been ready to commit for 90+ min; want me to land it?").
  - **harvest Fleet 2 unblock**: LC queue must cycle ≥10 real drafts
    AND ≥1 produces a user-promoted memory before Fleet 2 PRDs can
    cite live evidence. The prefilter ships+ships+ships discipline
    eventually meets the threshold organically.
  - **fidelity Fleet 1 #1**: recall-surfaced-tracking, smallest of
    the 5, no deps. Still 0/5 after ~28.5h since drop. Watch for
    first ship.
  - **/triage skill `--kind feedback` bug**: still single-evidence
    (one self-review hit at 09:34Z). Second independent surfacing
    promotes to PRD.

Notes for next /dream:
  - Harvest is fulfilled — drop that vision from triggers list.
    Next pass triggers: (a)(b)(c) unchanged, (d) replaced with
    "agentns first commit lands" if pass 15 still shows uncommitted
    userspace work (escalation from watch-item to trigger).
  - If state delta remains bookkeeping-only across 4+ passes plus
    harvest just fulfilled, consider whether the rest-pace pattern
    is masking a stalled queue rather than indicating discipline.

## 2026-05-28T11:30  /dream  no-fleet-pass (15th; agentns escalation — user-nudge time)

Manual /dream ~30min after 11:00Z pass-14. FIFTEENTH /dream no-fleet-pass.
Pass-14's promised escalation fires: agentns userspace work is now at FOUR
consecutive passes uncommitted, and the on-disk mtime evidence is far worse
than pass-14's "90+ min" estimate.

State delta since 11:00Z (~30 min):

  - **2 new autobuilder commits, neither a Fleet 1 ship**:
    - **ff02bb6** `build/autobuilder: skill-doctor intent-card.json
      (Stage 1)` — intra-PRD progress on PRD-skill-doctor (continuity-
      adjacent but not a continuity Fleet 1 PRD). Stage 1 of a
      multi-stage build.
    - **2932220** `build-deferred-acs: declare AC7 deferred (overtaken
      by events)` — iter-6 on the build-deferred-acs PRD. Adds
      `deferred_acs: [7]` to its OWN frontmatter, with `(no reason
      given)` falling back to PRD reasons map. AC7 (greppable Deferred:
      trailer) cannot fire on the 4 historical archive commits that
      pre-date archive-trailer.sh shipping at 3ab4e03 (iter-3); the
      mechanism is ready and will populate from this PRD's own archive
      forward. The PRD self-classifies the gap as overtaken-by-events
      rather than carrying it as missing-AC indefinitely. Honest move,
      first time deferred_acs has been used to declare a PRD's own
      AC deferred-for-cause (vs the 4 wintermute-* iter-5 backfills,
      which declared hardware-untestable ACs).

  - **agentns userspace work UNCOMMITTED, fourth pass — pass-14's
    nudge threshold crossed.** Critical correction to pass-13/14
    framing: `stat -c '%y'` on the files shows:
      - `userspace/agent-wrap.c`  → 2026-05-26 16:00:38 PT
      - `userspace/Makefile`       → 2026-05-26 16:00:40 PT
    That's **~36 hours ago, not 90 minutes**. Pass-13/14 reported the
    files as "in flight" — implying recent edits — but the on-disk
    mtimes show the work was completed Tuesday evening and has been
    sitting un-committed ever since. The framing "active work" was
    wrong; the framing is **stalled work**. agent-wrap binary also
    present (Makefile has been run at least once), so the work
    compiles. No new commits in ~/wintermute/agentns/ since a8a1845
    (kernel-side boot-hang fix at 2026-05-25 09:27 PT).

  - **/proc/self/agent_session still 32 zeros** — kernel surface
    unchanged. Wrapping gap unchanged.

Triggers from 11:00Z (per pass-14 prediction, harvest dropped,
trigger (d) replaced with "agentns first commit lands"):
  (a) claude-agentns-wrap ships → UNMET.
  (b) fidelity Fleet 1 ≥3/5 shipped → 0/5 UNMET (recall-surfaced-
      tracking still 0/5 after ~32h since drop).
  (c) new user articulation → manual /dream invocation, no topic
      seed. UNMET as a Fleet trigger; this manual invocation may
      be the user's signal to act on the nudge below.
  (d) **agentns first commit lands** → UNMET (still uncommitted).
      Now elevated from watch-item to trigger by pass-14's plan.

No PRDs drafted. Per rule 6 — no new evidence, no new motivation.

**User-offer surfaced this pass (per pass-14 plan):**

  The agentns userspace work has been on disk for ~36 hours without
  a commit (4 dream passes have observed it; first-observed on
  pass-12). The files are complete-looking: `agent-wrap.c` (~87 LOC,
  CLONE_NEWAGENT unshare + AGENT_INTENT prctl + ENOSYS/EPERM graceful
  degrade), `Makefile` (gcc -O2 -Wall -Wextra -std=gnu11), built
  `agent-wrap` binary. Same 5 modified files in main agentns/ from
  prior passes (.gitignore, README.md, kernel/agent_namespaces.c,
  tests/test_inheritance.sh, tests/test_unshare.c) plus the
  untracked tests/unshare-helper.c.

  This is the load-bearing PRD for continuity Fleet 1 (5 PRDs
  blocked on non-zero agent_session: claude-agentns-wrap pairs
  recall-session-stamp + memlog-witness + session-postmortem +
  provq).

  Phrasing to surface to user: "Want me to commit + push the
  agentns userspace work? Or is something pending (Cargo.toml
  unsure, AC mapping incomplete, tests not run) that's blocking
  the commit?" The dream-side cannot answer the second question
  without making assumptions about user intent on un-authored work.

Curation considered, none warranted: 57 PRDs, 12 active visions,
inventory unchanged.

Watch items carrying forward:
  - **claude-agentns-wrap**: now elevated to trigger (d). If next
    pass shows commits, fires Fleet 2 onramp PRD drafting (5 bullets
    captured in vision-onramp doc).
  - **fidelity Fleet 1 #1**: recall-surfaced-tracking, smallest, no
    deps. Still 0/5. ~32h since drop.
  - **chord-async-delegate / drift-fix-self-review-dream**: still
    user-gate-blocked per self-review run 10.
  - **/triage `--kind feedback` bug**: still single-evidence; second
    surfacing promotes to PRD.

Meta-observation for /dream rule 11+ pass arc:
  - Pass-12/13/14 all called agentns "in flight". The mtime check
    this pass exposes that framing as wrong; the files are stalled,
    not active. Lesson: when reading "uncommitted untracked work",
    always `stat -c '%y'` the files. "In flight" implies recent
    edits; "stalled" implies user blockage. The first triggers a
    watch-then-wait posture; the second triggers a user-nudge. The
    distinction matters and dream missed it for 3 passes. Logged
    into visions/freshness.md §Evidence log as freshness-on-files
    candidate (mtime is the cheap source of truth for "active
    vs stalled" claims about uncommitted work). NOT drafted as PRD.

Notes for next /dream:
  - If agentns lands (commits + push), fire trigger (d) Fleet 2:
    draft onramp Fleet 2 (5 bullets, all in vision doc).
  - If agentns still uncommitted at pass 16, escalate again: ask
    the user directly in the dream output whether the work is
    actually blocked on review, on a test, or on uncertainty about
    PRD-claude-agentns-wrap's exact contract; drafting a successor
    PRD that captures the on-disk implementation as Status:Implemented-
    pending-PRD-update would be a real option then.
  - Same other watches carry: fidelity Fleet 1 first ship,
    chord/drift-fix user-gates, /triage --kind feedback bug.

## 2026-05-28T12:00  /dream  no-fleet-pass (16th; agentns reframe — superseded, not stalled)

Manual /dream invocation from user (~30min after 11:30Z pass-15). SIXTEENTH
/dream no-fleet-pass. Pass-15's escalation plan fires, but the on-disk
investigation REFRAMES the agentns story entirely. Correction below
matters more than the no-fleet status.

State delta since 11:30Z:

  - **0 new autobuilder commits.** Manifest last_updated 11:52:16Z
    (pre-pass-15). 52 PRDs queued, 13 visions active+1 fulfilled
    (harvest, marked pass-14).
  - **agentns parallel-impl discovered**: pass-12/13/14/15 all framed
    `~/wintermute/agentns/userspace/agent-wrap.c` as "in flight" then
    "stalled" then "user-nudge-time". The on-disk file IS stalled (~44h
    since mtime 2026-05-26 16:00 PT), but it is no longer the load-
    bearing path. **/autobuilder built the Rust version today** at
    `~/wintermute/agentns-claude/` — committed at 90a808d "iter-1:
    autobuilder Stages 1+2 scaffold from PRD-agentns-claude" with src/,
    tests/, scripts/, Cargo.toml/lock, dual MIT/Apache LICENSE,
    CHANGELOG, README. Manifest shows agentns-claude.status=in_progress,
    last_action 2026-05-28T11:56:44Z (~50min before this pass), inside
    the autobuilder Stages 1+2 scaffold cycle. The Rust impl is the
    canonical PRD-agentns-claude shipping target (j0yen/agentns-claude).
  - **The C wrapper is therefore superseded, not stalled.** It is
    a hand-built predecessor from before the /autobuilder pipeline
    kicked in. Per [[feedback_always_build_autobuilder]] memory: hand-
    rolling is the wrong instinct; the autobuilder version is canonical.
    Keeping the C wrapper uncommitted at this point is correct (it
    would just be dead code in the agentns kernel-side repo). Either:
    (a) commit as `examples/agent-wrap.c` for documentation of the
    minimal C demonstration, or (b) `rm userspace/` since the Rust
    impl is now the path.
  - **/proc/self/agent_session still reads 32 zeros** — the unblock
    is the Rust autobuilder build LANDING (Stage 3+ → release-gate →
    ship) AND being installed at `~/.local/bin/agentns-claude`, then
    PRD-claude-agentns-wrap (Fleet 1 onramp #2) wiring zsh/systemd to
    route launches through it. C-version commit would NOT unblock
    this — even if committed, nothing installs from agentns/userspace/
    onto the path.
  - **recall reflective queue**: latest 10 reflective/self memories
    same as pass-15 — all recalls=0. Persistent freshness signal.

Triggers from 11:30Z:
  (a) claude-agentns-wrap ships → UNMET (Fleet 1 onramp #2; waits on
      agentns-claude shipping first per dependency chain).
  (b) fidelity Fleet 1 ≥3/5 shipped → UNMET (still 0/5; ~33h since drop).
  (c) new user articulation → MET? (bare /dream from user). No topic
      seed. Treated as "show me where the system is and act on
      anything you'd normally surface."
  (d) agentns first commit lands → REFRAMED: pass-15's framing assumed
      the C version was the path. Today's truth is the Rust autobuilder
      version IS landing (90a808d) and IS the load-bearing path. The
      original trigger fires in spirit (Fleet 1 onramp #2 onramp gate
      remains the install-and-wire step) but not on the artifact pass-15
      named. Treating as MET-but-reframed: Fleet 2 PRDs (5 bullets in
      vision-onramp doc) still wait for Stages 3+ to complete the
      autobuilder cycle on agentns-claude AND `~/.local/bin/agentns-claude`
      to actually be installable.

No PRDs drafted. Per rule 6: the on-disk situation does not motivate a
new component. The hand-built C wrapper is not a new PRD — it is a
cleanup decision. The autobuilder Rust build is in active progress; we
do not draft "ship this PRD" PRDs.

**User-offer surfaced this pass (REVISED from pass-15):**

  1. Cleanup decision: `~/wintermute/agentns/userspace/` has 87-LOC C
     wrapper + Makefile + compiled binary, ~44h since mtime, never
     committed. The Rust autobuilder version at `~/wintermute/agentns-
     claude/` is now canonical. Options:
       (a) Commit C as `examples/agent-wrap.c` (documents the minimal
           kernel-side userspace use; ~90 LOC vs whatever-the-Rust-
           CLI-grows-to).
       (b) `rm -rf userspace/` (clean break — Rust is the path).
       (c) Leave as-is (untracked, harmless but accumulating
           "stalled work" misreadings in future dream passes).
  2. Install-step question: is the autobuilder cycle for agentns-claude
     intended to drive all the way to `cargo install --path . --root
     ~/.local` automatically, or does the install step land in
     user-gate territory? The Fleet 1 onramp dependency chain
     (agentns-claude → claude-agentns-wrap → continuity Fleet 1 ×4)
     unblocks only when `which agentns-claude` resolves.

Watch items carrying forward:
  - **agentns-claude autobuilder Stages 3+ → release-gate**: this is
    the live load-bearing build. Watch for new commits beyond 90a808d
    in `~/wintermute/agentns-claude/` and status transition past
    in_progress.
  - **fidelity Fleet 1 #1**: recall-surfaced-tracking still 0/5
    (~33h since drop).
  - **chord-async-delegate / drift-fix-self-review-dream / etc**:
    5 blockers, all user-gate, all carried.
  - **/triage `--kind feedback` bug**: single-evidence still.

Meta-observation for /dream rule 11+ pass arc:
  - Pass-12/13/14/15 all carried the C wrapper as a watch item without
    `ls` of sibling repos. Pass-16 found the autobuilder Rust version
    by surveying `~/wintermute/` more broadly, not just by `stat`-ing
    the named file. Lesson for next pass: when an artifact has been
    "stalled" for ≥2 passes, broaden the search beyond the named file
    — adjacent repos and active /build manifest entries often reveal
    that the framing was wrong, not just the freshness.
  - 16 consecutive no-fleet-passes is now decisively a pattern. Not
    necessarily wrong — the queue at 52 PRDs and 13 visions is large,
    and the rule-6 honesty bar is high — but worth noting that
    /dream's "draft" output has not fired in 16 cron + manual invokes.
    The system shape is currently "harvest existing, do not propose
    new" until something Fleet 1 actually ships and earns the right
    to its Fleet 2.

Notes for next /dream:
  - If user picks option (a) or (b) above, capture in pass-17 gossip;
    no new PRD needed (cleanup, not feature).
  - If agentns-claude lands (build manifest status changes from
    in_progress to shipped + LICENSE-tagged push to j0yen/agentns-
    claude), fire trigger (d) Fleet 2 onramp 5-bullet draft pass.
  - Carry same other watches: fidelity Fleet 1 first ship, chord/
    drift-fix user-gates, /triage --kind feedback bug.

## 2026-05-28T12:30  /dream  no-fleet-pass (17th; bare /dream, harvest steady)

Manual invocation, no topic seed. 17th consecutive no-fleet-pass.

State delta vs pass-16 (~30 min ago):
  - **agentns-claude**: no new commits past `90a808d` (iter-1 Stages 1+2
    scaffold from 05:00 PT). Build manifest shows status=in_progress,
    last_action=11:56:44Z. Autobuilder cycle has not advanced past
    iter-1 within this 30-min window. Tree clean (no uncommitted edits).
    Target dir present (build artifacts) but no `receipts/` populated
    yet — Stage 3+ (release-gate) hasn't kicked off.
  - **agentns/userspace/ C wrapper**: unchanged (still uncommitted,
    pass-16 superseded-not-stalled framing stands).
  - **Fleet 1 fidelity**: 0/5 shipped (~33.5h since drop, was ~33h at
    pass-16 — clock advances, status unchanged).
  - **/build blockers**: 5, all user-gate, identical set to pass-16.
  - **recall reflective queue**: latest 10 reflective/self memories same
    as pass-16 — all recalls=0. Persistent freshness signal.
  - **agorabus**: 6 peers on bus this session (was 10 at pass-15 self-
    review; some sessions exited normally). All paired sub+worker.
  - **dirty trees**: per pass-16 self-review snapshot (agentns:7,
    autobuilder:3, cradle-bak:3, memlog:1, provfs:1, recall:5,
    peon-ping:2). Not re-scanned this pass (would steal `wchg since`
    delta from self-review).

Triggers from pass-16 (12:00Z), re-evaluated:
  (a) agentns-claude Stage 3+ commit lands → UNMET (still at iter-1).
  (b) fidelity Fleet 1 first ship → UNMET (0/5).
  (c) cleanup decision on userspace/ → UNMET (no user response yet).
  (d) install-step question → UNMET (no user response yet).
  (e) new user articulation → MET in form (bare /dream) but no topic
      carried; treated as "carry on" per the established 16-pass
      rhythm.

No PRDs drafted. Per rule 6: nothing on disk has changed enough to
motivate a new component. The 30-min cadence between pass-16 and
pass-17 is too short for the load-bearing Stage 3+ commit (autobuilder
inner-loop cycles run on /build's 5-min timer, not /dream's 30-min
timer; multiple build ticks should have fired but none produced a
visible commit — autobuilder is presumably running internal iter-2
verification work that doesn't surface as a top-level commit yet).

**Carried user-offers (REPEATED from pass-16, no new info this pass):**

  1. Cleanup decision: `~/wintermute/agentns/userspace/` C wrapper
     options (a) commit as examples/, (b) `rm -rf userspace/`,
     (c) leave as-is.
  2. Install-step question: should the autobuilder cycle for
     agentns-claude drive all the way to `cargo install --path . --root
     ~/.local` automatically, or is the install step user-gate?

Watch items carrying forward (unchanged):
  - agentns-claude autobuilder Stages 3+ → release-gate (watch for
    commits past `90a808d` and status transition past in_progress).
  - fidelity Fleet 1 #1 first ship (recall-surfaced-tracking 0/5).
  - chord-async-delegate / drift-fix-self-review-dream / etc:
    5 blockers, all user-gate.
  - /triage `--kind feedback` bug: single-evidence still.

Notes for next /dream:
  - The 17-pass arc warrants a pacing observation: /dream is running
    every ~30 min between 21:00-06:30 (cron timer) plus user manual
    invocations. Between cron + manual, /dream has fired 17 times
    against the same harvest-mode state. The "no-fleet-pass" output
    is not failure — it's the correct rule-6 response — but if /build
    spends another 6+ hours without surfacing a Fleet 1 ship,
    consider whether /dream's 30-min cadence is too aggressive for
    the current system state. (A 2-hour or per-/build-tick cadence
    might surface the same information with less compute.) Not a
    PRD — a config knob.
  - If user picks option (a) or (b) on the cleanup decision, pass-18
    can act on it directly (rm or `mv userspace/ examples/`); no
    PRD needed.
  - If autobuilder lands Stages 3+ on agentns-claude, fire Fleet 2
    onramp 5-bullet draft pass (PRD-onramp-* successors).

## 2026-05-28T13:00  /dream  fleet-movement-pass (18th invocation; corrects pass-17 no-fleet framing)

Manual /dream invocation from user, bare (no topic seed). 18th /dream pass in
the harvest arc — but the no-fleet-pass label finally breaks. The 30 min
between pass-17 (12:30Z) and pass-18 (13:00Z) carried four /build ticks that
landed real fleet movement; pass-17's "agentns-claude iter-1 still load-
bearing, nothing else moves" framing missed three other PRDs advancing.

State delta vs pass-17 (live manifest @ 12:57:30Z `last_tick_at`):

  - **provq SHIPPED** (continuity Fleet 1 #2). Three /build ticks landed
    between 11:47Z (install) and 12:57Z (publish):
      * iter-1 11:47Z: cargo build + install -Dm755 to ~/.local/bin/provq
        (970848 bytes); 18 tests green (9 unit + 5 scan + 4 show);
        `~/.local/bin/provq --version` → "provq 0.1.0".
      * iter-2 12:57Z: wm-publish allowlist + wm-publish --slug provq;
        repo public at https://github.com/j0yen/provq; REPOS.md row added
        (Session / context section); committed to wintermute@6a1e676.
    Verified-completed: AC1/AC2/AC3/AC8/AC9 paired; AC4-AC7 boot-gated
    per PRD §Boot-gated header (live FUSE-overlay + LSM xattr surface).
    Status held in_progress pending boot validation OR user-archive call.
    **This is the first continuity Fleet 1 ship.** Trigger for Fleet 2
    is "≥3 of 5 shipped" — 1/5 now, not 3/5; Fleet 2 draft pass does NOT
    fire.

  - **chord-claim iter-1 scaffold** (12:32Z, agorabus rust-extend).
    Extended protocol.rs with `ClientMessage::ClaimAcquire/Release/List`
    + new `ClaimRecord` struct (path/session_id/ttl_unix_secs/
    acquired_unix_secs/reason). Daemon `BusState` gains `claims:
    HashMap<canonical_path, ClaimRecord>` + `prune_expired_claims()`
    called before every read/write. Three new handle_line arms; client
    methods `claim_acquire/release/list`; nested CLI `agorabus claim
    {acquire,release,list}` with `--force/--wait/--path/--session-id/
    --format text|json` flags. cargo build --release green (25.76s);
    cargo test --release 9/9 PASS (no existing tests broken). Next:
    iter-2 writes AC tests, v0.1.0→v0.2.0 bump, commit + push via
    wm-push --slug agorabus.

  - **skill-doctor Stage 1+2 scaffold** (12:30Z).
    /autobuilder sub-skill invoked; intent-card.json derived directly
    from PRD §1-§5 + 11 ACs (no 5-Whys interview — PRD well-spec'd).
    iter-0 baseline commit 463dbed on branch autobuilder/skill-doctor.
    Tree: Cargo.toml + clippy.toml + deny.toml + rust-toolchain.toml +
    src/{main,lib}.rs + tests/acceptance_template.rs +
    agent/{intent-card,owner-map,test-map}.json + proof-lanes.toml +
    scripts/. No remote yet (publish is Stage 6, gated by ACs green).
    Next: Stage 3 iterate — implement extract.rs/check.rs/proposal.rs
    against AC1-AC6+AC8 (harness-testable subset).

  - **agentns-claude unchanged** since 11:56Z (iter-1 Stages 1+2
    scaffold at 90a808d on `~/wintermute/agentns-claude/`); no new
    commits, `target/autobuilder/receipts/` not yet populated.
    Pass-17's framing of this as the load-bearing build was correct
    but not exclusive — three other PRDs moved meaningfully alongside
    it.

  - **memlog-witness** (continuity Fleet 1 #3) flipped to
    `needs_classification` at 12:15Z. The classifier likely surfaced
    that `build_auto:false` on the PRD conflicts with the
    2026-05-27 user directive ("Every PRD is buildable. No opt-outs.
    ... if `build_auto` appears in an older PRD it's ignored").
    Three continuity Fleet 1 PRDs carry the legacy `build_auto:false`:
    memlog-witness (now classified), recall-session-stamp (still
    queued, 0 ticks), session-postmortem (still queued, 0 ticks).
    Per the new rule those flags are stale-by-policy. **Signal to
    /build:** treat the three legacy `build_auto:false` continuity
    PRDs as buildable; their queue position is the only thing
    blocking. (Not a new PRD — a policy-compliance reminder.)

Triggers from pass-17 re-evaluated:
  (a) agentns-claude Stages 3+ commit lands → UNMET (still at iter-1).
  (b) fidelity Fleet 1 first ship → still UNMET (0/5; ~34h drop-age).
  (c) cleanup decision on agentns/userspace/ C wrapper → UNMET.
  (d) install-step question (cargo install autopilot vs user-gate) →
      indirectly answered by provq's path: /build did go all the way
      to install -Dm755 + wm-publish autonomously, no user-gate. The
      same path is available for agentns-claude once /autobuilder
      finishes its release cycle.
  (e) new user articulation → MET (bare /dream from user, no topic
      carried). Treated as "show me where the system is and act on
      anything you'd normally surface" per the 17-pass rhythm.

No PRDs drafted per rule 6 (research doesn't motivate a new component).
provq shipping is 1/5 toward the Fleet 2 trigger; the Fleet-2 onramp
draft pass cited in pass-17 also does NOT fire (it gates on
agentns-claude shipping, not provq).

**Carried user-offers (UNCHANGED from pass-17, surfaces both still
open):**

  1. Cleanup decision: `~/wintermute/agentns/userspace/` C wrapper
     options (a) commit as examples/, (b) `rm -rf userspace/`,
     (c) leave as-is. (Now superseded by the autobuilder Rust path
     per pass-16; this is a tidy-up call only.)
  2. Install-step question for agentns-claude: should /autobuilder
     drive all the way to `cargo install --path . --root ~/.local`
     automatically (provq's path), or is the install user-gate? The
     Fleet 1 onramp dependency chain (agentns-claude →
     claude-agentns-wrap → continuity Fleet 1 ×4) unblocks only when
     `which agentns-claude` resolves.

**New user-offer surfaced this pass:**

  3. Three continuity Fleet 1 PRDs (memlog-witness,
     recall-session-stamp, session-postmortem) carry legacy
     `build_auto:false`. Per the 2026-05-27 directive these are
     buildable; memlog-witness already flipped to
     `needs_classification`. /build can either (a) honor the new
     rule and pick them up (`scan-prds.sh always emits build_auto:
     true`), or (b) wait for the user to flip the frontmatter on
     each of the three. Suggestion: honor the rule autonomously
     since the directive is unambiguous; the user-offer here is to
     confirm that interpretation.

Pacing observation (carrying from pass-17):
  - The 30-min /dream cadence DID catch a real ship event this pass.
    Pass-17's "consider a slower cadence" suggestion was premature —
    the cadence found something. Keep the 30-min cron schedule.
  - Reflective memory recall rate remains at 0 across the latest
    10 reflective/self entries; consider that an ongoing freshness
    signal but not a new PRD draft (the recall-surfaced-tracking
    PRD in Fleet 1 fidelity is the existing instrument for this —
    waiting for that to ship before re-evaluating).

Watch items carrying forward:
  - agentns-claude Stages 3+ → release-gate (watch for commits past
    90a808d and status transition past in_progress).
  - chord-claim iter-2 AC tests + v0.2.0 bump + agorabus push.
  - skill-doctor Stage 3 iterate (extract.rs/check.rs/proposal.rs).
  - fidelity Fleet 1 #1 first ship (recall-surfaced-tracking 0/5).
  - chord-async-delegate / drift-fix-self-review-dream / etc:
    5 blockers, all user-gate.

Notes for next /dream:
  - If memlog-witness picks up per the legacy-build_auto:false
    reading, the policy question is settled; remove the carry.
  - If agentns-claude lands Stages 3+ and `~/.local/bin/agentns-
    claude` becomes installable, fire the Fleet 2 onramp 5-bullet
    draft pass (PRD-onramp-* successors per pass-15 spec).
  - If chord-claim publishes (j0yen/agorabus v0.2.0), the chord
    vision's claim-primitive bullet is satisfied; check chord vision
    for next-bullet motivation.
  - If skill-doctor reaches Stage 6 publish, the skill-doctor
    bullet in (which vision? — verify) is satisfied.
  - When continuity Fleet 1 reaches 3/5 shipped, the Fleet 2 draft
    pass fires per the vision-doc trigger.

## 2026-05-28T13:25  /dream  agentns-on-path-confirm (19th invocation)

Manual /dream invocation from user, bare. 19th /dream pass; 25 min after
pass-18. State delta is small — pass-18 already captured the 4-tick burst
that landed provq/chord-claim-iter-1/skill-doctor-stage-1-2/agentns-claude-
install. This pass mostly confirms what landed and surfaces one
freshly-unblocked PRD.

Live verification this pass:
  - `which agentns-claude` → `/home/jsy/.local/bin/agentns-claude`
  - `agentns-claude --version` → `agentns-claude 0.1.0`
  - Confirms pass-18's manifest claim ("install -Dm755 to ~/.local/bin")
    actually reached PATH. Smoke-tested clean.

Git delta since pass-18 (12:57Z latest commit, last_tick_at 13:11Z, now
~13:25Z): NONE in the four hot repos.
  - agentns-claude: tip still 4e59669 (iter-2 from 06:06Z; install was a
    later /build action, not a new commit).
  - agorabus: tip still 2f5feee (external distribution prep); chord-claim
    iter-1 scaffold from 12:32Z is in working tree, not yet committed —
    iter-2 will commit + bump v0.2.0.
  - skill-doctor: tip still 463dbed (iter-0 scaffold); Stage 3 implement
    pending.
  - provq: tip still 387e5da (iter-1 scaffold) — published-and-archived
    state lives in wintermute@6a1e676 (REPOS.md row), not in repo itself.

**Newly-unblocked PRD signal for /build:**

  PRD-claude-agentns-wrap.md (onramp Fleet 1 #2) carries the dependency
  line "Depends on: PRD-agentns-claude.md shipped + installed at
  ~/.local/bin/agentns-claude". As of pass-18 this was the load-bearing
  precondition; as of pass-19 (verified above) it's satisfied. The wrap
  PRD is now a legitimate /build candidate. CAVEAT: build_target is
  `mixed` and build_into is `/home/jsy` — the PRD modifies ~/.zshrc,
  systemd-user units in ~/.config/systemd/user/, and ~/.claude/scripts/
  agorabus-session-start.sh in place. Even under the 2026-05-27
  "build_auto:false ignored" rule, this one is the rare in-place
  laptop-mod PRD where the user may want to gate. Recommendation to
  /build: prefer chord-claim iter-2 commit or skill-doctor Stage 3 next
  (both are isolated-repo work); surface claude-agentns-wrap to the
  user before applying any ~/.zshrc edit.

Fleet trigger status (unchanged from pass-18):
  - continuity Fleet 2: 1/5 confirmed shipped (provq); 2/5 if
    agentns-claude in_progress→completed counts. Threshold is 3/5.
    NOT armed.
  - onramp Fleet 2: 0/3 Fleet 1 shipped (kernel-pkg-postinstall,
    claude-agentns-wrap, provfs-comm-richer all queued). Threshold is
    2/3. NOT armed.
  - wintermute Fleet 1.5: announce-fix orphan PRD curation only;
    pass-16 trigger remained at curation-only, no Fleet 1.5 movement
    this pass.

Pacing note: pass-18 caught real ship movement (provq + chord-claim
iter-1 + skill-doctor stage-1-2 + agentns-claude install). Pass-19
caught a confirmation only. The 30-min /dream cadence is still
appropriate: it surfaces ship events as they happen but tolerates
quiescent intervals without producing noise PRDs.

**Carried user-offers (REPEAT, no new info):**

  1. Cleanup decision on `~/wintermute/agentns/userspace/` C wrapper
     (commit as examples/, rm -rf, or leave). Superseded by Rust path.
  2. Install-step question for agentns-claude: empirically answered
     by provq's and agentns-claude's parallel paths — /build does
     drive cargo install + ~/.local/bin install autonomously, no
     user-gate needed.
  3. Three continuity Fleet 1 PRDs (memlog-witness, recall-session-
     stamp, session-postmortem) carry legacy build_auto:false. Per
     2026-05-27 directive these are ignored and the PRDs are
     buildable. memlog-witness already flipped to needs_classification.
     Suggestion: /build honors the rule autonomously on the remaining
     two.

**New user-offer surfaced this pass:**

  4. claude-agentns-wrap is now dependency-satisfied. PRD modifies
     ~/.zshrc + systemd-user units + agorabus hook in place. Three
     options: (a) /build picks it up autonomously per the
     "no opt-outs" rule and applies edits; (b) /build drafts a
     proposals/ shadow (mirroring PRD-agorabus-boot-handshake's
     iter-1 pattern: draft to proposals/, user reviews, then user
     swaps live); (c) user explicitly gates this one PRD with a
     blocker entry. Suggestion: (b) — the agorabus-handshake pattern
     is already established for in-place laptop edits.

Watch items carrying forward:
  - agentns-claude wm-publish (j0yen/agentns-claude repo create).
  - chord-claim iter-2 AC tests + v0.2.0 bump + push.
  - skill-doctor Stage 3 implement extract/check/proposal.
  - claude-agentns-wrap: surface user-offer #4 above before any
    autonomous build action.
  - fidelity Fleet 1 #1 (recall-surfaced-tracking) still 0/5.
  - 5 chord/drift/etc. user-gate blockers — unchanged.

Notes for next /dream:
  - If claude-agentns-wrap proposals/ draft lands per option (b),
    log the draft path and AC count.
  - If agentns-claude publishes to j0yen, the install + publish
    sequence will count as the second continuity Fleet 1 ship
    (provq was first). Threshold for Fleet 2 stays at 3/5.
  - If chord-claim iter-2 publishes, chord-vision claim-primitive
    bullet is satisfied (agorabus v0.2.0).

## 2026-05-28T19:30  /dream  vision-companion
Seed: jsy said "for this to work with my mother, voice will need to be the
primary mode of interaction. you will need to always be listening, ready
to respond" (2026-05-28T19:18 PT). This is the deployment target.

Drafted:
- visions/companion.md
- PRD-wintermute-audio-inference.md (microWakeWord + Silero VAD)
- PRD-wintermute-stt-whisper-model.md (whisper.cpp + distil-small.en)
- PRD-wintermute-audio-aec.md (PipeWire module-echo-cancel)
- PRD-wintermute-dialog-turn-fsm.md (Listen→Wake→Capture→Transcribe→Think→Speak)
- PRD-wintermute-companion-boot.md (kiosk install, boot-on-power, no keyboard)
- PRD-wintermute-companion-degrade.md (phrase bank + wm.health.* envelopes)

Order:
  PRD-agorabus-multi-prefix-subscribe (already queued, blocks barge-in)
    ↓
  wintermute-audio-inference  ──  wintermute-audio-aec  (parallel)
    ↓
  wintermute-stt-whisper-model
    ↓
  wintermute-dialog-turn-fsm  ──  wintermute-companion-degrade  (parallel)
    ↓
  wintermute-companion-boot  (deployment capstone)

Notes for /build:
  - Each PRD is rust-extend, single-target, same shape as today's
    bus-startup-defect / heartbeat-keepalive / pipewire-output / pipewire-input
    series that all shipped via parallel autobuilder agents this afternoon.
  - The install-path drift (cargo install → ~/.cargo/bin; systemd →
    ~/.local/bin) is being explicitly fixed in companion-boot at the
    systemd unit level (/usr/local/bin/ system-wide). Sibling PRDs
    should not assume the drift is permanent; companion-boot lands it.
  - Inference (PRD-wintermute-audio-inference) and aec (PRD-wintermute-
    audio-aec) can run in parallel agents. Everything else is gated.
  - Don't dispatch dialog-turn-fsm before stt-whisper-model is
    verified-completed — the FSM needs real stt.final events to test.
  - companion-degrade's AC10 requires stopping wm-stt to simulate
    "ears gone" — coordinate with whatever other PRD work touches stt.

Open questions (left in visions/companion.md):
  - Wake word: "hey wintermute" (two syllable, higher false-positive) vs
    "okay nabu" (stock microWakeWord model, well-trained). Defer to deploy.
  - Local vs cloud STT — defer; PRD-wintermute-stt-whisper-model goes local.
  - Form factor — laptop, RPi Zero, RPi 5, mini-PC. Build PRDs target laptop.
  - First greeting — "Wintermute is ready" is utilitarian. Personality is
    sibling vision.
  - Multi-turn memory — wmd is stateless across turns. Future vision
    *continuity-of-conversation*.


## 2026-05-28T21:06  /dream  vision-continuity-of-conversation
Seed: companion vision OQ#5 ("wmd is stateless across turns ... deferred to
a future vision: continuity-of-conversation") + dialog-turn-fsm non-goal #1.
Grounded in code: wintermute-brain's handle_turn_user builds the request from
one transcript (daemon.rs:1057), test pins req.messages.len()==1 (daemon.rs:1585);
recall_client.rs defers the write/embed path ("lands when the brain starts
writing memories back, a separate iter"); lib.rs:45-47 defines an unused
thread-subject convention (THREAD_SUBJECT_PREFIX / thread_subject_for).

Drafted:
- visions/continuity-of-conversation.md
- PRD-wmd-turn-history.md       (foundation: bounded Vec<Message> into the request)
- PRD-wmd-session-boundary.md   (ts-gap + explicit-close session edges; wm.brain.session.{start,end})
- PRD-wmd-repair-affordances.md ("say that again / louder" via in-session replay, no LLM round-trip)
- PRD-wmd-memory-writeback.md   (session.end -> extract facts -> recall write/embed, as proposals)
- PRD-wmd-session-recap.md      (session.start -> recall last thread -> continuity context/opener)

Order:
  wmd-turn-history
     ├──► wmd-repair-affordances   (needs only the in-session buffer)
     └──► wmd-session-boundary
              └──► wmd-memory-writeback
                       └──► wmd-session-recap

Notes for /build:
  - ALL FIVE are rust-extend into ~/wintermute/wintermute-brain and ALL touch
    daemon.rs/handle_turn_user. They SERIALIZE — do not dispatch two in
    parallel autobuilder agents; they will collide. Build in dependency order.
  - wmd-turn-history rewrites the daemon.rs:1585 single-message assertion to the
    new multi-turn invariant (messages.len()==2*history.len()+1). Rewrite, don't
    delete — the PRD specifies the replacement invariant + AC1 covers it.
  - wmd-memory-writeback is the first wmd->recall WRITE; recall_client.rs only has
    ping/query/touch today. The PRD adds the write/embed client method mirroring
    recall's length-prefixed framing (MAX_FRAME_BYTES=4MiB). Writes go as recall
    *proposals* by default (writeback_auto_commit=false) so triage reviews them.
  - writeback + recap both route through lib.rs thread_subject_for() — neither
    should invent a new recall subject.
  - No new deps expected (extraction reuses the Anthropic client with a distinct
    prompt; writeback_model default Haiku). Same shape as the companion fleet.

Open questions (in visions/continuity-of-conversation.md):
  - Session-id provenance: brain-side ts-gap inference (v0.1) vs a wm-dialog-minted
    session id stamped on wm.dialog.turn.user (sibling dialog PRD). Defer.
  - Privacy of writeback: a companion writing mother's words into a searchable
    store is a real surface. Proposals-by-default is the v0.1 mitigation; full
    consent/boundaries is sibling vision *family-boundaries*.
  - recap_opener default-off: an unprompted continuity greeting is a
    personality/deployment call (companion.md OQ#4).

## 2026-05-28T21:40  /dream  vision-vigil
Seed: run-18 self-review re-opened "agorabus daemon stale binary" the SAME
day it was resolved (runs 16-17). Caught live in Phase 1: pid 2138939 still
exec'ing `/home/jsy/.local/bin/agorabus (deleted)` — the 20:52 reinstall
unlinked its inode. Third axis of staleness, sibling to freshness (memory)
and drift (skill text): a RUNNING PROCESS on stale code.
Grounded in: `/proc/2138939/exe` (deleted) [kernel-truth]; provfs
`user.prov.ts=1780026726` on ~/.local/bin/agorabus [LSM stamp]; agorabus
`enum Command` has NO doctor/restart surface (read src/main.rs); `pevent list`
empty (daemons unsupervised); journal runs 16/17/18 all hand-flag this.

Drafted:
- visions/vigil.md
- PRD-binstale.md                 (rust-cli, new repo: read-only /proc+provfs detector)
- PRD-binstale-source-cmp.md      (rust-extend binstale: `behind-head` vs git HEAD)
- PRD-rollout.md                  (rust-cli, new repo: safe serialized rolling restart)
- PRD-binstale-self-review.md     (shell: wire binstale scan into self-review B.5)
- PRD-agorabus-doctor-selfstale.md (rust-extend agorabus: `agorabus doctor`)

Order:
  binstale
     ├──► binstale-source-cmp
     ├──► binstale-self-review
     └──► rollout
  agorabus-doctor-selfstale  (independent)

Notes for /build:
  - binstale + rollout are SEPARATE new repos by design: binstale is
    read-only (safe), rollout mutates the live fleet (opt-in, --dry-run
    default). Don't fold them together.
  - binstale-source-cmp and binstale-self-review both depend on binstale;
    ship binstale FIRST. rollout can ship on binstale alone (acts on
    deleted-exe/inode-drift) but is better with source-cmp's behind-head.
  - **DO NOT let any build of agorabus-doctor-selfstale (or anything that
    reinstalls agorabus) kill the live bus daemon pid 2138939.** It is
    deliberately escalated/not-restarted (run-18). Restarting the bus is
    rollout's job under a chosen window, or the operator's. Build+install
    only; no restart side effects.
  - binstale-self-review degrades safely if binstale isn't installed yet —
    can land in either order vs PRD-binstale.
  - rollout requires a user-authored ~/.config/rollout/fleet.toml launch
    recipe; it refuses daemons it has no recipe for. No auto-restart of
    unknown processes.

Open questions (in visions/vigil.md):
  - Per-daemon launch recipe provenance (install.sh uses cargo install ->
    ~/.cargo/bin but running binary is ~/.local/bin/agorabus via comm:install;
    two paths). Discuss canonical launch path before any rollout apply.
  - Brief peer-drop on bus restart acceptable, or need socket-handoff first?
    (SessionStart handshake re-attaches — see PRD-agorabus-boot-handshake,
    itself user-gate-blocked.)
  - rollout-window-guard (precise turn-in-flight guard) deferred to Fleet 2;
    depends on continuity-of-conversation's wm.brain.session.{start,end}.

## 2026-05-29T05:15  /dream  vision-scribe
Seed: self-review runs 16/17/18 (2026-05-28) hand-count ctrace "missing
summaries" 1→4→5 every tick and never fix them. Phase 1 caught the root
cause live: the summarizer is NOT slow (renders 12MB/124k-event log in
1.7s by hand this session) and claude-stop.err is EMPTY — the SessionEnd
hook never RAN. Cause = ungraceful exit: headless build/dream/self-review
sessions get SIGKILLed by cgroup teardown (memory
self_build_detached_cgroup_teardown), SIGKILL delivers no SessionEnd, so
ctrace-session-end.sh never renders and the tracer is orphaned. Nothing
backfills. Measured: 828 *.ndjson vs 810 *.summary.md = 18 holes; the 5
oldest are the heavy build/kernel sessions (T162617 12MB, T163729 10MB,
T164732 10MB, T181900, T220013-live).

Drafted:
- visions/scribe.md
- PRD-ctrace-scribe.md                 (rust-cli, NEW repo: single-pass renderer + backfill engine)
- PRD-ctrace-scribe-rollup.md          (rust-extend ctrace-scribe: cross-session daily digest)
- PRD-ctrace-scribe-selfreview.md      (shell: wire backfill+rollup into self-review B.5)
- PRD-ctrace-session-end-resilient.md  (shell: SessionStart backfill sweep + hardened hooks)
- PRD-ctrace-orphan-reap.md            (rust-cli, NEW repo: reconcile orphaned tracer state)

Order:
  ctrace-scribe
     ├──► ctrace-scribe-rollup
     ├──► ctrace-scribe-selfreview      (needs backfill + rollup)
     └──► ctrace-session-end-resilient  (needs backfill)
  ctrace-orphan-reap                    (independent; pairs with session-end-resilient)

Notes for /build:
  - ctrace-scribe is the ROOT — ship it first. rollup/selfreview/resilient
    all shell out to `scribe`. All three DEGRADE SAFELY if scribe isn't on
    PATH yet (fall back to summarize-ctrace-session.sh), so they can scaffold
    ahead and their non-scribe paths are testable today.
  - ctrace-scribe + rollup are pure read/render of ~/.cache/ctrace/sessions
    — safe, no live-system mutation. Test against /tmp fixture dirs.
  - ctrace-session-end-resilient ships its hook changes as *.draft.sh under
    proposals/ (user-gated swap into ~/.claude/scripts/, same precedent as
    PRD-agorabus-boot-handshake). DO NOT auto-swap the live SessionStart/End
    hooks — those touch every session boundary.
  - ctrace-scribe-selfreview edits the self-review skill's Phase B.5; same
    shape as PRD-binstale-self-review (vigil). Wrap the backfill write in the
    existing wchg scope-guard on ~/.cache/ctrace/sessions.
  - ctrace-orphan-reap is read-by-default, --apply opt-in, --apply --dry-run
    available. It signals ONLY the recorded tracer PID and only when the
    owner is dead — never a live-owned tracer.

Relationship to other visions:
  - COMPLEMENTS session-postmortem (visions/continuity.md), which *consumes*
    ctrace as one of its four substrates — a hole-free summary record makes
    that join honest. Not a duplicate; scribe fills the record, postmortem
    reads it.
  - orphan-reap RHYMES WITH vigil's running-process staleness axis but is
    distinct: vigil = stale *binary* on a healthy process; orphan-reap =
    leaked *tracer* whose owner died. Keep separate.

Open questions (in visions/scribe.md):
  - Replace summarize-ctrace-session.sh outright, or keep it as scribe's
    fallback? (leaning: keep as fallback; resilient hook prefers scribe)
  - ctrace has no source repo (python script + .bt + 2 shell scripts) —
    scribe is a NEW repo, not an extend. Confirm before wrapping ctrace.
  - Backfill cadence: SessionStart + self-review (v0.1) vs a dedicated
    timer (probably overkill at this volume).

## 2026-05-29T06:05  /dream  vision-signet
Seed: ~20 consecutive self-review runs flag agentns `/proc/self/agent_session`
all-zeros as "the lone broken kernel asset." Phase 1 probed it live and the
diagnosis is WRONG: kernel is healthy (CONFIG_AGENT_NS=y, /proc/self/ns/agent
resolves -> inode 4026531996 = init-ns range, agent_counters is valid JSON).
All-zeros is the CORRECT reading of a process in the INIT agent namespace —
nothing called unshare(CLONE_NEWAGENT) on the launch path. The kernel isn't
broken; nothing READS the signet correctly. The self-review check
(SKILL.md:123-124) only knows two states ("present" / "empty|missing ->
registration failed") with no branch for present-but-all-zeros = init,
unwrapped, EXPECTED.

Grounded in: live /proc probe this session [kernel-truth]; recall reflective
01KSS21WFN... "agentns all-zeros ~20th run"; SKILL.md:123-124 verbatim; only
agentns-claude (of 8 ~/.local/bin tools) touches the surface and only WRITES
the sid — nothing reads agent_counters; procstat covers cgroup not agentns;
PRD-claude-agentns-wrap.md §Out-of-scope explicitly deferred "a claude-doctor
CLI to check namespace status from outside" — signet builds exactly that.

Drafted:
- visions/signet.md
- PRD-agentns-doctor.md             (rust-cli, NEW repo j0yen/agentns-doctor: tri-state status/explain/counters)
- PRD-agentns-doctor-self-review.md (shell: rewrite B.5 agentns block, kill the 20-run misdiagnosis)
- PRD-agentns-session-receipt.md    (rust-extend agentns-doctor: per-session counter ledger, ctrace-joinable)

Order:
  agentns-doctor
     ├──► agentns-doctor-self-review   (shells out to doctor; degrades w/o it)
     └──► agentns-session-receipt      (rust-extend of doctor)

Notes for /build:
  - agentns-doctor is the ROOT — ship first. It's READ-ONLY (/proc only; never
    writes /proc/*/agent_*, never unshares, never signals). Safe to build+install.
  - Classify by VALUE (session==all-zeros AND file present => init), NOT by a
    hardcoded init-ns inode — the inode differs across observations (4026531996
    this session vs 4026531837 on 2026-05-27); treat inode as advisory only.
  - --proc-root <dir> test hook makes absent/live/malformed FIXTURE-testable
    TODAY without a wrapped session. Most ACs are today-testable; only the
    *live* (non-zero) half of a few ACs is wrap-gated -> declare deferred_acs.
  - agentns-doctor-self-review ships as proposals/*.draft.md, NOT a live
    SKILL.md edit (skill self-mod is classifier-gated; same precedent as
    agorabus-boot-handshake + ctrace-session-end-resilient drafts). It DEGRADES
    safely if the doctor isn't installed (fallback cat with corrected text), so
    it can land in either order vs PRD-agentns-doctor.
  - session-receipt is meaningful only for a WRAPPED session (counters are zero
    in init ns). --require-wrapped exits non-zero in init state so automated
    callers don't litter zeros-receipts. Honest about the precondition.

Relationship to other visions:
  - SIBLING of onramp: onramp's claude-agentns-wrap builds the WRAPPER (makes
    the sid non-zero); signet builds the READING of it (whether zero or not).
    Neither blocks the other — the doctor is useful NOW precisely because it
    explains why today's sessions read zero. onramp Fleet 2's onramp-doctor
    bullet ("runs all three checks") should SHELL OUT to agentns-doctor for the
    agentns third, not re-implement it.
  - COMPLEMENTS scribe + session-postmortem: ctrace counts a session from
    OUTSIDE (eBPF), agentns counts from INSIDE (kernel per-ns hooks);
    receipt --join-ctrace makes the two joinable on agent_session_id. Not a
    duplicate.

Open questions (in visions/signet.md):
  - Init-ns inode stability across boots (classify by value, not inode).
  - Receipt emission trigger: pull-based (self-review calls receipt --emit
    --require-wrapped) vs push-on-SessionEnd (unreliable for headless sessions
    per the SIGKILL-skips-hook problem scribe is fixing). Leaning pull-based.
  - Receipt location ~/.cache/agentns/receipts/<sid>.json mirrors ctrace's
    layout for a sibling-glob join — confirm before wiring.

## 2026-05-29T06:10  /dream  vision-kin
Seed: companion vision OQ#6 (un-dreamed until now) — "does jsy get
notifications when mother summons wintermute? Does mother have a way to call
jsy through it? Sibling vision." Rooted in the original companion seed
("for this to work with my mother…"). User invoked /dream bare, declined to
pick among four offered directions → took the most human un-dreamed one.

Grounded in live Phase 1: bus topics that exist are wm.audio.* / wm.tts.* /
wm.stt.final / wm.brain.reply / wm.browser.{cmd,reply} — NO wm.family.* or
wm.presence.* anywhere (net-new, honestly). wm.browser.cmd→reply
(wintermute-browser/src/protocol.rs:73,85) is the request/reply precedent
reused for wm.family.message→reply. NO outbound transport in any daemon
(grep twilio|ntfy|gotify|webhook|sms = 0) → wm-reach is the new boundary.
bootstrap/install.sh is 217 lines with no caregiver wizard → companion's
"mDNS caregiver-setup flow already assumes a headless device" was
aspirational; family-enroll builds it for real.

Drafted:
- visions/kin.md
- PRD-wintermute-family-intents.md   (rust-extend wintermute-dialog: Family FSM branch, defines wm.family.* contract)
- PRD-wintermute-family-distress.md  (rust-extend wintermute-dialog: deterministic distress fast-path, non-API)
- PRD-wintermute-reach.md            (rust-cli, NEW j0yen/wintermute-reach: off-device transport to jsy)
- PRD-wintermute-presence.md         (rust-cli, NEW j0yen/wintermute-presence: opt-in interaction heartbeat)
- PRD-wintermute-reach-digest.md     (rust-extend wintermute-reach: daily calm digest, joins presence+reach)
- PRD-wintermute-family-enroll.md    (rust-cli, NEW j0yen/wintermute-family-enroll: caregiver setup wizard, capstone)

Order:
  family-intents (defines wm.family.* topics)
     ├──► family-distress     (safety fast-path; extends dialog)
     ├──► wintermute-reach    (transport; consumes wm.family.*)
     │        └──► reach-digest
     └──► wintermute-presence (emits wm.presence.*)
              └──► reach-digest
  family-enroll (config capstone; consumed by all)

Notes for /build:
  - family-intents is the GATE — ship first. It defines the wm.family.* topic
    constants the whole fleet keys on. Other repos declare matching string
    constants (agorabus topics are plain strings; no shared crate needed —
    keep them identical to kin.md's topic table).
  - family-distress MUST stay off the Claude API path (deterministic phrase
    match) — same reasoning companion-degrade used; a distress path gated on
    the brain fails exactly when it matters. Its spoken assurance reuses
    wintermute-brain/src/degrade.rs's phrase mechanism — don't invent a 2nd
    TTS path.
  - family-distress and wintermute-reach can build in PARALLEL once intents
    lands (trigger + delivery). reach closes the FamilyPending→ack loop that
    family-intents opens, so until reach ships every family message times out
    into "I couldn't reach Joe" (expected, not a bug).
  - presence is independent of reach (only emits); reach-digest joins them
    and is the last of the runtime pair.
  - Privacy defaults are LOAD-BEARING (vision OQ#2): presence/silence/digest
    default OFF, distress defaults ON. Don't ship a device that phones home
    about Mom unless family-enroll wrote the opt-in. presence reads only THAT
    a turn happened + transcript LENGTH, never the text.
  - Two new daemons (wintermute-reach, wintermute-presence) follow the shipped
    wm-* shape (subscribe loop + self-emitted-topic filter + heartbeat) and
    must fix the cargo-bin-vs-local-bin install drift at the unit level — the
    regression that bit four companion PRDs.
  - SIBLING of continuity-of-conversation: "tell Joe what I said earlier"
    needs turn memory = continuity's job. kin assumes single-turn intents for
    v1; multi-turn family messages wait on continuity shipping.

Open questions (in visions/kin.md):
  - Transport jsy actually wants on his phone (email/ntfy/gotify/SMS)? wm-reach
    wires email first, gates the rest behind Cargo features. NEEDS jsy.
  - Privacy/consent: does mother hear, in wintermute's voice, what's shared?
    (family-enroll has a `wm-family announce` for exactly this.) NEEDS jsy.
  - Hard-vs-soft distress line (immediate fire vs "Should I let Joe know?").
  - Inbound reply channel (email-poll vs webhook) — wm-reach v1 is send-only
    with a `wm-reach reply` CLI stub; v2 makes inbound real.

Aside (not a kin item): wmd-init.service is FAILED (status=203/EXEC,
start-limit-hit, 8h) and wm-kernel-pkgrel6-*.service FAILED. Flagging for the
companion-reliability surface / next self-review — not in kin's scope.

## 2026-05-28T22:45  /dream-adjacent  research → 5 PRDs (autobuilder quality)
Drafted: PRD-autobuilder-spec-drift-probe.md,
  PRD-autobuilder-mutation-testing.md,
  PRD-autobuilder-reviewer-promotion.md,
  PRD-autobuilder-semantic-ac-judge.md,
  PRD-autobuilder-hardware-mock-convention.md
Research: research/quality-verification-2026-05-28.md

**Trigger:** user prompt "think hard about how to verify quality of
autobuilder-generated Rust code." Survey (Explore agent +
autobuilder/SKILL.md read) showed: lint/test/adversarial harness is
solid; what slips through is LLM-specific (spec drift, tautological
test breadth, reviewer-concern-ships, deferred ACs accumulate). 5 PRDs
designed against the 5 named failure modes.

**Priority:** all 5 `build_priority: high` per user request "bump to
top priority in queue." Also patched /build SKILL.md Phase 2 to sort
queued candidates by build_priority desc (priority field was being
parsed into manifest but not honored at selection time).

**Notes for /build:**
  - Order of leverage: spec-drift-probe (cheapest, blocks biggest
    observed failure mode) → mutation-testing (telemetry first,
    calibrates the eventual gate) → reviewer-promotion (no new code,
    just calibration discipline + auto-promotion playbook in
    /self-review) → semantic-ac-judge (new rust-cli at ~/wintermute/
    ac-judge/, mixed target — rust portion via /autobuilder, then
    self-mod step wires the binary into Stage 4) → hardware-mock-
    convention (touches PRD frontmatter parser + verified-completed
    check #5 + 5 wintermute crate backfills).
  - Mutation-testing PRD ships Phase 1 only (telemetry); Phase 2 gate
    is a future PRD after 20 crates have data.
  - Reviewer-promotion ships Phase A only (calibration log);
    Phases B and C are auto-promoted by /self-review when thresholds
    trip — no human-drafted follow-on needed.
  - Hardware-mock-convention's backfill of 5 wintermute crates will
    spawn 5 follow-on PRDs at iter-N (one per crate). Expect queue
    growth.
  - Semantic-ac-judge is the most expensive PRD (mixed target,
    LLM API in the loop, golden-set calibration); reserve ~3 ticks.
  - All 5 cite research/quality-verification-2026-05-28.md by section;
    /build can re-read the report when scope-checking each.

**Notes for next /dream:** if any of the 5 ships, the matching
failure-mode catalog in §3 of the report shrinks. After 3/5 ship,
re-run the survey and look for the NEXT slip-through pattern (the
report deliberately stopped at 5 to ship leverage rather than over-
catalog).

## 2026-05-29T06:40  /dream  vision-homestead (NEW vision)
Drafted: PRD-wintermute-fleet-install-doctor.md,
  PRD-wintermute-install-path-convention.md,
  PRD-wintermute-unit-recovery-watchdog.md,
  PRD-wintermute-readiness-beacon.md
Vision: visions/homestead.md
Seed: bare /dream + Phase-1 live inspection. Picked direction myself
  (user declined the direction question).

**Trigger (live, verified this pass):** `wmd-init.service` is
`failed (Result: start-limit-hit)`, `status=203/EXEC` — `ExecStart=
/usr/local/bin/wmd-init` does not exist; the binary is at
`~/.local/bin/wmd-init`. Three install conventions across six fleet
units (`~/.cargo/bin` wm-audio, `~/.local/bin` the rest, `/usr/local/bin`
wmd-init). 5/6 resolve by luck; the outlier is dead and stays dead
(no human to reset-failed on mother's device). Also confirmed
`WM_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=` is EMPTY — wm-brain runs but can't reason,
with no deploy-time gate. This is the homeless "companion-reliability
surface" the vision-kin gossip aside (2026-05-29T06:10) explicitly
punted: "flag for the companion-reliability surface / next self-review
— not in kin's scope." homestead is that surface's home.

Order: fleet-install-doctor → { install-path-convention (uses doctor as
  its install gate), readiness-beacon (consumes doctor's per-unit
  verdict) }; unit-recovery-watchdog is independent and can ship in a
  parallel agent.

**Notes for /build:**
  - All four are rust-extend into ~/wintermute/wintermute-platform
    (which already ships the `wmd-init` and `wm` binaries — doctor/ready
    add subcommands to `wm`; watchdog adds a new `[[bin]]`). Same
    rust-extend shape as the companion fleet.
  - Build doctor FIRST and expose its unit-resolution as a shared lib
    function — both install-path-convention (post-install gate) and
    readiness-beacon (units check) consume it. Don't fork the logic.
  - install-path-convention has the load-bearing real-world AC: take
    `wmd-init.service` from failed → active on this laptop (reconcile
    path → reset-failed → start → is-active=active). That's AC4 and it's
    the whole point — verify it live.
  - SCOPE BOUNDARIES (do not merge): companion-boot = power-button→boot
    phrase (reboot-scoped recovery). companion-degrade = mid-conversation
    failure voice (phrase bank in wm-brain). vigil/binstale = STALE/
    deleted running binary vs HEAD. homestead = ABSENT ExecStart path +
    runtime failed-unit recovery + standing readiness verdict. The
    `wm.health.*` envelope is OWNED by companion-degrade's design and
    CONSUMED by vision-kin's health digest — readiness-beacon must
    REUSE it (AC5), not invent a parallel one. The boot phrase is shared
    with companion-boot — suggest boot owns the "ready" phrase, beacon
    owns the "not-ready" reasons (beacon OQ).
  - Two user-decisions gate full ship (vision OQs): which path
    convention wins (~/.local/bin default), and watchdog scope
    (user vs system). Neither blocks doctor or beacon.

**Notes for next /dream:** homestead deliberately stops at 4. A 5th
component — unifying vigil's stale-detector and homestead's absent-path
detector under one `wm doctor` surface — is real but premature until
both ship; left as a vision boundary note, not a PRD. If the user sets
the API key and deploys to real hardware, the next undreamed surface is
*remote operability* (how does jsy push a fix to a device he can't SSH
into?) — not dreamed here because no remote device exists yet.

## 2026-05-29T00:30  /dream  vision-thrift
Drafted: PRD-brain-prompt-cache.md, PRD-wm-router.md, PRD-wm-skills.md,
  PRD-wm-semcache.md, PRD-wm-local-llm.md
Vision: visions/thrift.md
Seed: jsy — "build in /autobuilder instead of the expensive anthropic API".
  Grounded: wmd (wintermute-brain) is the fleet's ONLY API consumer (STT/TTS
  already local). Two wastes found live: (1) MessageRequest has NO cache_control
  despite intent-card AC3 targeting >=60% cache-read, AND compose_persona splices
  volatile recall INTO the system prompt (busts caching); (2) every utterance
  escalates to Sonnet unconditionally.

Order: brain-prompt-cache (INDEPENDENT — ship first, pure per-call saving, no
  new crates, zero quality tradeoff). Then wm-router (spine) ──< {wm-skills,
  wm-semcache, wm-local-llm} build in parallel (all consume router's Route enum).

Notes for /build:
  - brain-prompt-cache is rust-extend into wintermute-brain; its AC5 is the
    repo's EXISTING cache_hit_ratio_above_60pct test (intent-card AC3) — carry it
    forward, don't invent a new one. Watch the existing serialization tests
    ("system omitted when None") — backward-compat is AC2.
  - The 3 new lib crates (router/skills/semcache/local-llm) reuse recall's `embed`
    socket RPC (recall/src/daemon.rs:27 OPS includes "embed"; BGE-small 384-dim,
    HashEmbedder fallback 256-dim). Do NOT stand up a second embedder. Clients
    must be DIM-AGNOSTIC (read vector len from response).
  - wm-local-llm wraps the OpenAI-compatible /v1/chat/completions PROTOCOL, not a
    specific binary — jsy is testing a runtime (ollama/llama-server/llamafile)
    in a parallel window. No weights vendored; endpoint+model are config.
  - DO NOT wire any of this into wintermute-dialog yet — vision component 6
    (dialog-FSM wiring) is intentionally NOT drafted; it waits on
    PRD-wintermute-dialog-turn-fsm shipping (vision OQ1).
  - family-intents overlap (vision OQ2): wm-skills' family skill must REUSE the
    wm.family.* contract from PRD-wintermute-family-intents, not fork the topic.

Open questions for jsy: confidence-floor + local-llm stakes-boundary calibration
  (vision OQ4/OQ5 — local-llm route ships GATED OFF by default); does the brain
  see pre-handled turns for continuity (OQ3 — lean: side-effecting skills write
  recall, pure lookups don't).

## 2026-05-29T07:30  /dream  vision-docket (NEW vision)
Drafted: PRD-docket-core.md, PRD-docket-escalate.md,
  PRD-docket-evidence.md, PRD-docket-self-review-bind.md,
  PRD-docket-digest.md
Vision: visions/docket.md
Seed: bare /dream + Phase-1 recall reflective seeds + journal recurrence
  + self-review SKILL.md. Picked direction myself (no topic given).

**Trigger (live, verified this pass):** the self-review rediscovers the
same findings every run and parks them as PROSE, with no structured
identity, count, or lifecycle. Evidence:
  - `grep -l "Carried forward" ~/brain/journal/*.md` → 6 CONSECUTIVE
    days (05-24..05-29). "agorabus stale binary" appears 7× in the
    05-28 journal alone, 3× in 05-29.
  - `self-review/SKILL.md:359` codifies "playbook justified when a
    signal recurs across 3+ separate runs" — but recurrence is EYEBALLED
    across `recall query` prose. Run-18/19 reflective memories
    (01KSRV7R…, 01KSS21W…) literally say the stale-binary item is
    "approaching the 3-runs threshold" — the agent is hand-counting.
  - `~/.claude/skills/self-review/state/` does NOT exist — the skill has
    no structured state. Carry-forward = one free-text reflective memory
    per run (SKILL.md:452-465).
  - "agentns session-zeros" Pending ~21 consecutive runs with no
    escalation event — proof that without a mechanical rule, escalation
    never fires.

docket = the missing third staleness axis. vigil watches running
binaries vs source; freshness watches memory bodies; drift watches skill
text; docket watches the self-review's OWN findings accumulate, recur,
escalate, and auto-close.

Order:
  docket-core → { docket-escalate, docket-evidence } →
  docket-self-review-bind (needs core+escalate) ; docket-digest (needs
  core, better with escalate).

**Notes for /build:**
  - docket-core is a NEW rust-cli → publish j0yen/docket,
    ~/.local/bin/docket. The other three are rust-extend INTO
    ~/wintermute/docket (same crate, new subcommands/tables; idempotent
    migrations). docket-self-review-bind is build_target: mixed — it
    edits ~/.claude/skills/self-review/SKILL.md (ADDITIVE anchors only,
    no rewrite) + adds scripts/docket-runid.sh.
  - Build core FIRST and freeze the report/list contract (run model,
    stable-key convention) — escalate/evidence/digest all extend the
    same store. Don't fork the schema.
  - docket-self-review-bind has the load-bearing AC: replace the
    hand-maintained "Carried forward" prose (SKILL.md:414) with `docket
    list --open`, and the line-359 playbook rule with `docket list
    --escalated`. Verify end-to-end against the real binary (report 4
    seeded keys across 3 runs → agorabus-stale-binary escalates; a
    1-run finding auto-resolves on sweep).
  - SCOPE BOUNDARIES (do not merge): docket is a per-KEY lifecycle state
    machine (open→escalated→resolved, run-streak counting). recall is
    similarity-retrieval over prose. docket LINKS to recall ULIDs
    (`recall:<ulid>` evidence refs) but is NOT a recall extension. Keep
    them separate tools.
  - ENVELOPE REUSE (hard): docket-digest's JSON MUST reuse the
    `wm.health.*` envelope OWNED by companion-degrade and CONSUMED by
    kin / homestead's readiness-beacon (per the 2026-05-29T06:40
    homestead note). Match field names exactly against companion-degrade's
    shipped crate/contract — do NOT invent a parallel schema. A digest
    test must assert conformance.
  - NON-DESTRUCTIVE: every self-review→docket call is list/report/sweep.
    The binding adds ZERO new user-gated blockers. docket-digest
    documents (does NOT auto-modify) the SessionStart hook snippet —
    that wiring stays user-gated.

Open questions (vision OQs, user-gated, none block core):
  - Run identity string format (proposed YYYY-MM-DD.<n>).
  - Store format SQLite (leaning) vs JSONL-in-git.
  - Future producers (vigil binstale, readiness-beacon, /build blockers)
    all reporting to ONE docket — left as a vision boundary note, not a
    v1 PRD, until the self-review producer proves the contract out.

**Notes for next /dream:** docket deliberately stops at 5 with the
self-review as the SOLE v1 producer. The multi-producer surface (a
unified docket fed by vigil + homestead + /build, with cross-tool dedup)
is real but premature until the single-producer contract ships. Don't
draft it until docket-self-review-bind is green on this laptop.

## 2026-05-29T01:00  /dream  vision-thrift  (+1 PRD)
Drafted: PRD-brain-backend-ladder.md  (rust-extend -> wintermute-brain)
Trigger: jsy decision this session — "default to local 3b. wire up switches to
  use 8b, Sonnet and Opus when needed." Plus wm-local-llm is mid-build (the local
  backend client it depends on).
Design: extends the EXISTING LlmClient trait seam (wintermute-brain
  src/daemon.rs:88) + swap-model/default-model CLI (src/main.rs:54-95). A
  LadderClient dispatches a turn to local (wm-local-llm) vs Anthropic by active
  tier; default_tier=local-3b; auto-escalates one rung when a local tier returns
  LocalOutcome::Escalate; bounded at the top.
Notes for /build:
  - DEPENDS ON wm-local-llm (path dep) — build that FIRST (in flight now,
    branch autobuilder/wm-local-llm). Don't start the ladder until wm-local-llm
    passes its gate.
  - COMPOSES WITH PRD-brain-prompt-cache (AC8): the Anthropic tiers must keep
    their cache_control breakpoints. If prompt-cache hasn't landed, the ladder
    just passes MessageRequest through unmodified.
  - Load-bearing behavior change: build_anthropic_client -> None (no API key) no
    longer disables the brain when default tier is Local. Missing key only
    disables Sonnet/Opus tiers. This fixes the "brain mute, no key" outage class.
  - Reuse the existing LlmClient fake-injection test pattern for AC2/AC3/AC5.
Order now: prompt-cache (independent) ; wm-local-llm -> brain-backend-ladder ;
  wm-router -> {wm-skills, wm-semcache, wm-local-llm-as-router-tier}.

## 2026-05-29T07:30  /dream  vision-hearth  (+3 PRDs, new vision)
Drafted: PRD-hearth-persona-config.md, PRD-hearth-first-contact-greeting.md,
  PRD-hearth-dialog-degrade-warmth.md
Vision: visions/hearth.md
Seed: no user topic given this invocation; chose the strongest *uncovered*
  evidence after confirming the freshness/identity/recovery space is saturated
  (vigil/signet/onramp/homestead/docket all cover tonight's infra anomalies —
  agentns all-zeros, agorabus stale binary, ctrace flakes — so piling on there
  would violate "don't dream past the research"). hearth fills companion.md's
  own deferred OQ#4 ("what does she hear the first time?") + dialog-turn-fsm
  Non-goal #2 ("personality model … blunt for v0.1").

What's the gap (all confirmed by reading source in Phase 1):
  - Persona is a compile-time const: wintermute-brain/src/daemon.rs:47
    DEFAULT_PERSONA. Not in brain.toml (which already has user_name/timezone/
    recap_opener). -> persona-config lifts it to a [persona] table.
  - recap_opener flag exists (lib.rs:100) but NO greeting content defined, and
    no first-ever-boot welcome. -> first-contact-greeting.
  - wm-dialog degrade.rs:44-45 returns IDENTICAL "Sorry, I didn't catch that."
    for SttUncertain AND TranscribeTimeout, no variation. -> dialog-degrade-warmth.

SCOPE BOUNDARY (do not merge): hearth is the VOICE (persona/greeting/warm
  phrasing); companion-degrade (*say-so*) is the PLUMBING (operational fault
  bank in wm-brain keyed by component error kind, owns wm.health.*). They share
  the wm-tts path but are different concerns. The dialog degrade.rs module
  comment forward-references companion-degrade for "mood-aware phrasing" — that
  reference is MIS-AIMED: companion-degrade builds in wm-brain and never touches
  the wm-dialog FSM bank. hearth-dialog-degrade-warmth is the real owner of that
  file. No PRD touched it before (grep-confirmed).

Order: persona-config -> first-contact-greeting (both -> wintermute-brain) ;
  dialog-degrade-warmth (-> wintermute-dialog, independent, ship anytime).

Notes for /build (IMPORTANT — brain serialization):
  persona-config + first-contact-greeting both extend wintermute-brain's
  compose_persona / BrainConfig surface, as do the IN-FLIGHT brain-prompt-cache
  and brain-backend-ladder PRDs. FOUR PRDs touch the same system-prompt
  composition + config struct. Serialize them or expect rebases. Suggested
  order if brain-prompt-cache lands first: prompt-cache -> persona-config
  (persona is the cached prefix; AC5 asserts prefix byte-stability) ->
  first-contact-greeting. brain-backend-ladder is orthogonal (dispatch tier),
  can interleave but watch BrainConfig merges.
  dialog-degrade-warmth has NO brain dependency — dispatch it freely.

Open questions (vision OQs, none block v1):
  - Learned persona (recall wintermute-profile subject) vs configured — deferred
    until persona-config proves the data shape.
  - One register across two repos (brain.toml vs wm-dialog phrases) can drift;
    consistency check deferred until both are config-sourced.

## 2026-05-29T01:30  /dream  vision-thrift  switching strategy LOCKED (+1 PRD, 2 revised)
Drafted: PRD-wm-verify.md (rust-lib ~/wintermute/wm-verify) — soft-failure gate.
Revised: PRD-brain-backend-ladder.md -> v0.2 ; PRD-wm-router.md -> v0.2 (both have
  in-file Changelog sections; v0.1 behavior is a strict subset).
jsy locked the switching strategy (vision "Switching strategy" section):
  - Ladder: local-3b -> local-8b -> HAIKU -> Sonnet -> Opus (Haiku added).
  - Posture: LOCAL-FIRST (cheapest tier that clears the bar; default 3b).
  - Latency: FILLER WHILE ESCALATING (backchannel via companion-degrade phrases).
  - "When needed" decided TWICE: predict (router stakes/start tier) + verify
    (wm-verify gate). Pure escalate-on-hard-failure was blind to a 3b answering
    confidently WRONG — wm-verify closes that.
Notes for /build:
  - wm-router v0.2: Route is now Skill/CacheLookup/Brain{stakes}. NO LocalLlm
    route anymore — the brain ladder owns local-vs-cloud. Safety stage runs FIRST
    (high recall) and tags Stakes::HighStakes(class) so the ladder skips local for
    medication/medical/emergency/distress/money. AC4 = 100% high-stakes recall.
  - brain-backend-ladder v0.2 now DEPENDS ON wm-verify + wm-router (not just
    wm-local-llm). Escalation = dual-signal (hard wm-local-llm Escalate + soft
    wm-verify reject). Build order: wm-local-llm(done) + wm-verify + wm-router
    -> brain-backend-ladder.
  - wm-verify is pure/in-process (no network, no model). Conservative toward
    Reject but AC6 forbids false-rejecting normal answers (would nuke local-first).

## 2026-05-29T08:34Z  /dream  vision-earshot  (manual /dream, no topic)
Drafted: PRD-earshot-dialog-timing.md, PRD-earshot-vad-patience.md,
  PRD-earshot-tts-legibility.md, PRD-earshot-gentle-reprompt.md
Vision: visions/earshot.md
Seed: companion.md's "a non-technical elder, jsy's mother" + hearth's own
  scope note. hearth made the WORDS warm; earshot makes sure she can HEAR
  them and isn't RUSHED. New domain, grep-confirmed unclaimed by any PRD.

What's the gap (all confirmed by reading source in Phase 1):
  - Conversation tempo is compile-time: wintermute-dialog/src/fsm.rs
    CONFIRM_TIMEOUT_MS=30_000 (fsm.rs:28), MAX_REPROMPTS=1 (fsm.rs:31),
    family re-exported lib.rs:34-35. Not in a config table. An elder who
    pauses gets cut off. -> earshot-dialog-timing (const->[timing], same
    move hearth-persona-config made for the persona string).
  - One reprompt then silent exit: Confirming->ConfirmTimeout->
    DenyReason::Silence->Idle (fsm.rs:236-252); reprompt path exists
    (fsm.rs:402-415) but capped at 1. -> earshot-gentle-reprompt (patient
    sequence + warm SPOKEN close).
  - TTS has no rate/volume: PiperSubprocess::render passes only --model +
    --output_file (synth.rs:101-105), no --length_scale, no gain anywhere.
    -> earshot-tts-legibility (slower + louder for hearing loss).
  - VAD silence-hangover (speech.end "after confirmed silence",
    events.rs:27) tuned for normal speech, not configurable. ->
    earshot-vad-patience (longer default so a mid-sentence pause != end).

SCOPE BOUNDARY (do not merge): earshot-gentle-reprompt owns the SILENCE /
  no-response path in fsm.rs ("I'm still waiting for you"). hearth-dialog-
  degrade-warmth owns degrade.rs, the FAULT bank ("I didn't catch that").
  Different module, different trigger, shared wm-tts path. earshot must
  NOT touch degrade.rs; hearth must NOT touch the fsm silence branch.

Order: earshot-dialog-timing (foundation, introduces [timing]) ->
  {earshot-vad-patience (wm-audio, independent), earshot-tts-legibility
  (wm-tts, independent)} parallel -> earshot-gentle-reprompt (wm-dialog,
  reads dialog-timing's max_reprompts + cadence).

Notes for /build:
  - earshot-dialog-timing + earshot-gentle-reprompt BOTH edit fsm.rs in
    wintermute-dialog — serialize them (timing first, verified, then
    reprompt). Do NOT dispatch concurrently.
  - hearth-dialog-degrade-warmth is in-flight on the same crate. No logic
    overlap (degrade.rs vs fsm.rs) but lib.rs re-export / Cargo churn may
    force a rebase on the earshot dialog PRDs. Watch it.
  - vad-patience (wm-audio) + tts-legibility (wm-tts) are fully
    independent of the dialog PRDs and of each other — parallel agents OK.
  - Tests pin the old const timing values (e.g. fsm.rs:642
    StartConfirmTimer{ms}==CONFIRM_TIMEOUT_MS). REWRITE to the config-
    sourced invariant, don't delete (continuity-of-conversation discipline
    for req.messages.len()).
  - Defaults are elder-friendly (more patient, slower, louder) but tunable;
    setting knobs to neutral/old values must reproduce today's behavior.

Open questions (vision OQs, none block v1):
  - Learned pace (widen silence window from observed cut-offs) vs static
    config defaults — deferred to a later vision.
  - Higher TTS gain feeds the AEC loop (companion's audio-aec must still
    cancel) — deployment smoke test, not a unit AC.
  - Three config tables (dialog [timing] / audio [vad] / tts [voice]) vs
    one caregiver-facing file — unification is a homestead/onramp concern.

## 2026-05-29T09:06:28Z  /dream  vision-almanac  (manual /dream, no topic)
Drafted: PRD-almanac-schedule-store.md, PRD-almanac-tick-daemon.md,
  PRD-almanac-speak-bridge.md, PRD-almanac-acknowledge.md,
  PRD-almanac-missed-to-kin.md
Vision: visions/almanac.md
Seed: manual /dream during the live companion push. companion can HEAR,
  hearth speaks WARM, earshot WAITS + is legible, kin LINKS to jsy. The
  missing panel: CLOCK-driven proactive speech. The whole fleet is
  reactive (does nothing until summoned); an elder's real load is the
  on-time recurring things she forgets — pills, meals, the nurse at 2.

The gap (confirmed by reading source in Phase 1):
  - No clock-driven proactive turn anywhere. wm-brain's only proactive
    speech is recap_opener (daemon.rs:1352), fired once at session start.
    BrainConfig (lib.rs:80-118) has timezone but nothing scheduled.
  - wm-cal is NOT this: it's a CalDAV daemon for JSE's appointments —
    SecretService creds (creds.rs:16), RRULE expansion (caldav.rs:397),
    caregiver-facing by design (intent-card.json:17). Network+account
    required. Wrong shape for "blue pill at 8am" on a maybe-offline desk.
    almanac is LOCAL, recurring, opt-in, spoken — and CONSUMES
    wm.cal.event.upcoming later rather than reimplementing CalDAV.
  - Reuse, don't rebuild: speak-bridge emits through the EXACT proactive
    path recap_opener uses — ReplyEvent{text,ts} -> publish(REPLY)
    (daemon.rs:1352-1377) — so prompts inherit hearth's persona +
    earshot's pace automatically.

SCOPE BOUNDARIES (do not merge): almanac owns the CLOCK (when to prompt).
  hearth owns WORDS/persona; earshot owns TEMPO/patience; kin owns
  OFF-DEVICE delivery. almanac adds NO persona string, NO timing const,
  NO CalDAV. acknowledge READS earshot's patience window; missed-to-kin
  RIDES kin's wm.family.* channel.

Order: schedule-store (new crate wintermute-almanac, foundation) ->
  tick-daemon (publishes wm.almanac.due) -> {speak-bridge (wm-brain,
  due->spoken), missed-to-kin (wm-almanac, wm.almanac.missed)} parallel
  -> acknowledge (wm-brain, next wm.stt.final -> done/snooze/missed;
  feeds missed-to-kin).

Notes for /build:
  - schedule-store is a NEW crate at ~/wintermute/wintermute-almanac
    (companion-fleet member like wintermute-calendar). Ships alone as a
    useful CLI; everything else extends it or wm-brain.
  - speak-bridge + acknowledge BOTH edit wintermute-brain (subscribe-loop
    dispatch + DaemonState). Serialize them (speak-bridge first, verified,
    then acknowledge which adds PendingAck on top). Do NOT dispatch
    concurrently on wm-brain.
  - tick-daemon + missed-to-kin both extend wintermute-almanac; serialize
    on that crate too (tick-daemon first — it defines the wm.almanac.due
    envelope + agorabus client; missed-to-kin adds the watch/bridge).
  - speak-bridge depends on the wm.almanac.due envelope shape from
    tick-daemon — wait for tick-daemon's README envelope doc before
    building speak-bridge.
  - missed-to-kin bridges to kin's wm.family.message. kin is still a
    VISION (family-* PRDs in flight per last gossip). missed-to-kin's
    AC3 makes it ship WITHOUT kin (emits wm.almanac.missed only; kin
    bridge is conditional). Build almanac without blocking on kin.
  - hearth-* and earshot-* edit wm-dialog/wm-brain too — watch for
    Cargo/lib.rs re-export churn forcing a rebase on speak-bridge/ack.
  - Envelope contract (pin in wintermute-almanac README so all consumers
    agree): wm.almanac.due {id,label,say,category,fire_ts};
    wm.almanac.ack {id,state:done|snoozed|missed}; wm.almanac.snooze
    {id,resume_ts}; wm.almanac.missed {id,label,category,missed_ts}.

Open questions (vision OQs, none block v1):
  - Caregiver remote editing of mom's routine -> kin/onramp/homestead
    concern, not almanac (wm-almanac add is the v1 interface).
  - Quiet hours / active_hours per entry — deferred (defaulting risks
    silently skipping a real med prompt).
  - Learned timing (shift from observed ack latency) — same learned-vs-
    static deferral earshot made. Static local_time for v1.

## 2026-05-29T02:33  /dream  vision-vigil (extend → Fleet 3)
Drafted: PRD-agorabus-client-reconnect.md, PRD-agorabus-drain-notice.md,
  PRD-agorabus-state-persist.md, PRD-agorabus-reload.md,
  PRD-agorabus-reload-self-review.md
Vision: visions/vigil.md (extended — resolved Open Question #3; added Fleet 3)

Why this fleet: the carried-forward "agorabus daemon stale binary" debt
(self-review runs 16–19 + 2026-05-29) has a single root cause that no
existing PRD addressed. Phase 1 read agorabus/src/client.rs and confirmed
the long-lived `subscribe` client has NO reconnect logic — when the daemon
dies the subscriber dies with it, and agorabus-session-start.sh only
re-registers at session START, never on daemon death. So a live bounce
strands every current session. That's why self-review's
agorabus_daemon_stale_binary playbook escalates instead of auto-fixing
whenever subscribers > 5 (SKILL.md:259,270). Fleet 3 builds the handover
MECHANISM that makes the bounce non-destructive.

Order: client-reconnect (keystone, ship FIRST)
  → drain-notice (reconnect consumes resume_after_ms backoff)
  → state-persist (independent of drain; finishes daemon.rs:72's deferred
    persistence — claims+intents survive a bounce)
  → reload (depends on reconnect+drain+persist; the one-command bounce)
  → reload-self-review (depends on reload SHIPPED+VERIFIED; rewrites the
    playbook to call `agorabus reload` and lift the ≤5 ceiling).

Notes for /build:
  - SERIALIZE the four agorabus rust-extends (reconnect → drain → persist
    → reload). All touch the same crate (protocol.rs/daemon.rs/main.rs/
    client.rs); concurrent /autobuilder agents will collide on Cargo/lib.rs
    re-export churn — same caution Fleet 1 raised for the companion fleet.
  - client-reconnect is the ONLY one that ships value alone and unblocks
    everything; prioritize it. It has no dependency and no protocol change.
  - drain-notice adds a `bus.draining` ServerEvent variant — coordinate
    with any in-flight agorabus PRD that also edits protocol.rs.
  - reload-self-review is build_target:shell editing
    self-review/SKILL.md — do NOT build it until `agorabus reload` is
    installed and verified (its whole premise is calling that command).
  - Composes with vigil Fleet 1 `rollout` (not a duplicate): rollout is
    the fleet-wide orchestrator; it can shell out to `agorabus reload` for
    the bus specifically and fall back to SIGTERM+relaunch for daemons
    that lack a reload verb. Fleet 3 makes rollout's brief-drop assumption
    actually safe.
  - LIVE-FLEET CAUTION: building/testing these will exercise daemon
    restarts. The running bus (pid ~1750 per 2026-05-29 self-review) is
    itself stale and carries the live voice fleet + sessions. Don't bounce
    the production daemon during a test — tests use their own --socket /
    --state-file under a temp dir.

Open questions (none block v1):
  - reconnect-self-survival window: should the reconnect loop give up and
    exit after a configurable wall-clock (so a truly-dead bus doesn't leave
    zombie subscribers forever), or retry until the session ends? PRD
    leaves it unbounded by default with --max-reconnect-attempts to bound.
  - state-persist scope: persist ONLY claims+intents (chosen) vs also a
    last-known peer snapshot for `peers` display during the reconnect gap.
    Deferred — peers re-announce within seconds via reconnect.

## 2026-05-29T03:00  /dream  vision-atlas (new)
Drafted: PRD-atlas-core.md, PRD-atlas-edges.md, PRD-atlas-orphans.md,
  PRD-atlas-render.md
Vision: visions/atlas.md (new)
Order: atlas-core (keystone, ship FIRST — node model + parsers)
  → atlas-edges (attaches dependency edges to the nodes)
  → atlas-orphans (divergence lint; needs nodes + edges)
  → atlas-render (DOT/Mermaid/tree; needs nodes + edges)

Why this vision: bare `/dream`, interactive. Phase 1 found the
feature-space SATURATED and well-targeted — every evidence-motivated pain
already has a PRD home (agorabus-stale → vigil Fleet 3 drafted tonight
02:33; agentns all-zeros → PRD-claude-agentns-wrap; ctrace SessionEnd
flake → PRD-ctrace-session-end-resilient; finding recurrence → docket).
The one genuinely-uncovered gap is meta: the /dream end-state is "each
PRD a node in a graph," yet NOTHING renders that graph. 107 PRDs / 24
visions / 2 manifests / 3922-line gossip / 117-line REPOS.md — the edges
are all written down (PRD `Vision:`+`build_into` frontmatter, build
manifest `output_repo_path`/`iter_log`, dream manifest prds_drafted, our
own `Order:` lines) but never joined. atlas is one read-only Rust CLI
that joins them.

Notes for /build:
  - SERIALIZE the three rust-extends (edges → orphans → render). All
    extend ~/wintermute/atlas; concurrent /autobuilder agents collide on
    Cargo/lib.rs re-export churn — same caution every multi-extend fleet
    raised (vigil Fleet 1/3, companion).
  - atlas-core is the ONLY one that ships value alone and unblocks the
    rest; build it first. New repo j0yen/atlas, no dependency, no store.
  - orphans and render are independent of each other — order either way
    after edges.
  - atlas is READ-ONLY over the autobuilder corpus by design (AC asserts
    fixture mtime unchanged). It will read this gossip file + both skill
    manifests — but never writes them. Don't let an /autobuilder agent
    "helpfully" add a write path.
  - `atlas doctor` (from atlas-orphans) is exactly the fulfilled-vision
    cross-reference /dream SKILL.md says it does by hand. Once orphans
    ships+verifies, the natural capstone is a build_target:shell PRD
    wiring `atlas doctor` into self-review — deliberately NOT drafted yet
    (premise is calling installed+verified `atlas doctor`; mirrors how
    vigil held agorabus-reload-self-review behind `agorabus reload`).
    Left as vision OQ for next /dream extend atlas.

Open questions (none block v1):
  - atlas vs docket overlap: NO. docket = self-review FINDINGS get an
    identity/lifespan; atlas = the vision/PRD/repo CORPUS gets a rendered
    structure. They could meet later (atlas reports a stale-repo
    divergence AS a docket finding) — future cross-vision bullet.
  - edge source-of-truth: frontmatter `Depends on:` authoritative, gossip
    `Order:` lines secondary/dashed. Pinned in atlas-edges README.

## 2026-05-29T10:15  /dream  (saturation report — no PRDs drafted)
Manual bare /dream, interactive. Phase 0/1 sweep confirms the 03:00
vision-atlas pass's finding still holds 7h later: the corpus is
SATURATED. State: 111 PRD-*.md files, 25 visions, this gossip at ~3970
lines, build manifest tracking 154 PRD entries.

Deliberately drafted NOTHING this pass (hard rule #6 — don't dream past
the research). No laptop fact changed since 03:00 to motivate a net-new
vision. Today's two self-reviews surfaced only USER-GATED items, each
already PRD-covered or not PRD-shaped:
  - agorabus daemon stale binary (~19th consecutive run) → PRD-agorabus-reload
    + PRD-agorabus-doctor-selfstale already drafted; blocked on a restart
    window, not on code.
  - agentns agent_session all-zeros (~22nd run) → kernel/boot-side;
    PRD-claude-agentns-wrap + PRD-agentns-doctor cover the userspace side.
  - ctrace SessionEnd hook flake → PRD-ctrace-session-end-resilient.
  - memlog group membership / bpolicy load / pacman kernel update → not
    PRD-shaped (usermod / sudo / reboot — user's call).

Signal for /build: the constraint is THROUGHPUT + user-gated decisions,
not draft supply. 111 drafts deep; 9 hard-blocked (PRDs 2,5,9,14,19,28,
53,57,118), all user-gated. Draining beats drafting right now.

Open question for next /dream: the genuinely-changed fact is the
wintermute kernel BOOTED 2026-05-28 (provfs LIVE + stamping xattrs,
/dev/memlog present, agentns the lone gap). continuity Fleet 1 was
boot-gated and is now UNBLOCKED — that's a /build action, not new
dreaming. The net-new dreaming white space, IF the user wants it next
pass, is userspace consumers of the now-live provfs/memlog surface
beyond what continuity drafted. Asked the user for direction; question
dismissed, so leaving it as the seed for an explicit `/dream <topic>`.

## 2026-05-29T11:00  /dream  (saturation report — no PRDs drafted)
Third consecutive no-draft pass (after 03:00 vision-atlas + 10:15). Bare
interactive /dream at ~04:00 PDT. Phase 0/1 confirms corpus unchanged
since 10:15: 111 PRD-*.md, 25 visions, build manifest 154 entries. No
laptop fact moved in the ~45min since the last pass.

Self-review run 2 (02:04 PDT) surfaced only USER-GATED items, all already
PRD-covered or not PRD-shaped: agorabus stale binary (~19th run), agentns
all-zeros (~22nd run), ctrace SessionEnd flake, memlog group membership,
bpolicy load, pacman kernel 7.0.9->7.0.10. None net-new draftable.

Offered the user the one genuine white-space (userspace consumers of the
now-live provfs xattr / /dev/memlog surface beyond vision-continuity) +
topic/extend/stop. Question dismissed. Held the line on rule #6 — drafted
nothing.

Signal for /build unchanged: constraint is THROUGHPUT + user-gated
decisions, not draft supply. 111 deep, 9 hard-blocked (2,5,9,14,19,28,53,
57,118). Draining beats drafting. The provfs/memlog-consumer seed remains
parked for an explicit `/dream <topic>`.

## 2026-05-29T11:30  /dream  (saturation report — no PRDs drafted)
Fourth consecutive no-draft pass (after 03:00 vision-atlas + 10:15 +
11:00). Manual interactive bare /dream at 04:30 PDT, ~30min after the
11:00 pass. Phase 0/1 + mandatory recall seeding confirm corpus
unchanged: 111 PRD-*.md, 25 visions, build manifest 154 entries. No
laptop fact moved since 11:00.

Recall seeding (rule: mandatory, not skipped): all reflective hits are
this-week self-review snapshots, recalls=0, pure carry-forward (agorabus
stale binary, agentns all-zeros, "kernel built not booted" — the latter
now itself STALE since the kernel booted 05-28). No net-new ideation
seed surfaced. Hybrid ideation query returned the same boot-pending
observations, all superseded.

Self-review today surfaced only USER-GATED items, each PRD-covered or
not PRD-shaped: agorabus restart window, agentns kernel registration,
memlog group membership, bpolicy load, pacman kernel 7.0.9->7.0.10.

Offered the user (interactive AskUserQuestion) the four real moves:
provfs/memlog-consumer white space / give-a-topic / extend-a-vision /
hold. Question dismissed. Held rule #6 — drafted nothing.

Signal for /build unchanged across 4 passes now: the constraint is
THROUGHPUT + user-gated decisions, not draft supply. 111 deep, 9
hard-blocked (PRDs 2,5,9,14,19,28,53,57,118), all user-gated. Draining
beats drafting. The genuine white-space seed (userspace consumers of the
now-live provfs xattr / /dev/memlog surface beyond vision-continuity)
remains parked for an explicit `/dream <topic>` when the user wants it.

## 2026-05-29T12:00  /dream  (saturation report — no PRDs drafted)
Fifth consecutive no-draft pass (after 03:00 vision-atlas + 10:15 + 11:00
+ 11:30). Manual interactive bare /dream. Phase 0/1 + mandatory recall
seeding confirm corpus unchanged: 112 PRD-*.md (was 111; +1 from concurrent
/build Phase-6 draft, not /dream), 25 visions, build manifest 154 entries.
No laptop fact moved since 11:30.

Recall seeding (mandatory): all reflective hits are this-week self-review
snapshots, recalls=0. Latest (01KSSPHV9B... run 3, 04:01 PDT) is pure
carry-forward: agorabus stale binary (~19th), agentns all-zeros (~23rd),
memlog group needed, bpolicy off, recall daemon socket absent. Today's
journal (2026-05-29 run 3) same — only USER-GATED items, each PRD-covered
or not PRD-shaped.

Offered the user (AskUserQuestion) the four real moves: provfs/memlog-
consumer white space / give-a-topic / extend-a-vision / hold. Question
dismissed again. Held rule #6 — drafted nothing.

Signal for /build unchanged across 5 passes: constraint is THROUGHPUT +
user-gated decisions, not draft supply. 112 deep. Draining beats drafting.
Genuine white-space seed unchanged: userspace consumers of the now-live
provfs xattr / /dev/memlog surface (kernel booted 05-28, provfs healthy +
stamping, /dev/memlog present) beyond vision-continuity. Parked for an
explicit `/dream <topic>` when the user wants it.

## 2026-05-29T12:30  /dream  (saturation report — no PRDs drafted)
Sixth consecutive no-draft pass (after 03:00 vision-atlas + 10:15 + 11:00
+ 11:30 + 12:00). Manual interactive bare /dream. Phase 0/1 + mandatory
recall seeding confirm corpus unchanged: 108 PRD-*.md, 25 visions, build
manifest 154 entries. No laptop fact moved since 12:00.

Recall seeding (mandatory): reflective hits all this-week self-review
snapshots, recalls=0, pure carry-forward (kernel built->booted 05-28,
agorabus stale binary, agentns all-zeros). ctrace --since 24h empty;
pevent list empty — nothing newly running to motivate a PRD. No net-new
ideation seed.

Offered the user (AskUserQuestion) four moves: draft the provfs/memlog-
consumer fleet (the lone research-backed white-space seed) / give-a-topic
/ extend-a-vision / hold-and-drain. Question dismissed (6th time). Held
rule #6 — drafted nothing.

Signal for /build unchanged across 6 passes: constraint is THROUGHPUT +
user-gated decisions, not draft supply. Draining beats drafting. Genuine
white-space seed unchanged and still parked: userspace consumers of the
now-live provfs xattr / /dev/memlog surface beyond vision-continuity.
Awaits an explicit `/dream <topic>` or an opt-in to the fleet above.

## 2026-05-29T14:00  /dream  (saturation report — no PRDs drafted)
Seventh consecutive no-draft pass (after 03:00 vision-atlas + 10:15 +
11:00 + 11:30 + 12:00 + 12:30). Manual interactive bare /dream. Phase 0/1
+ mandatory recall seeding confirm corpus unchanged: 108 PRD-*.md, 25
visions. No laptop fact moved since 12:30.

Recall seeding (mandatory): all reflective hits this-week self-review
snapshots, recalls=0, pure carry-forward (kernel built->booted 05-28,
agorabus stale binary, agentns all-zeros, memlog group needed). ctrace
--since 24h EMPTY; pevent list EMPTY — nothing newly running to motivate
a PRD. Kernel surfaces live but unconsumed: /dev/memlog present (uid 1000
still not in memlog group), /proc/self/agent_session all-zeros, provfs
stamping healthy. No net-new ideation seed.

Did NOT re-run the dismissed 4-way question verbatim. Offered ONE sharp
2-way call (draft the provfs/memlog userspace-consumer fleet — the lone
research-backed seed — vs hold-and-drain). Dismissed (7th time). Held
rule #6 — drafted nothing.

Signal for /build unchanged across 7 passes: constraint is THROUGHPUT +
user-gated decisions, not draft supply. Draining beats drafting. Genuine
white-space seed unchanged and still parked: userspace consumers of the
live provfs xattr / /dev/memlog surface beyond vision-continuity. Awaits
an explicit `/dream <topic>` or an opt-in to the fleet above.

## 2026-05-29T15:00  /dream  (saturation — no PRDs, ask-loop halted)
Eighth consecutive no-draft pass. Manual interactive bare /dream. Verified
live: 108 PRD-*.md, 25 visions, /build manifest 157 (up from 154 — build IS
draining). ctrace --since 24h EMPTY, pevent EMPTY. Recall reflective = all
this-week self-review snapshots, recalls=0, no net-new seed. Kernel surfaces
unchanged: uid not in memlog group, agent_session all-zeros, provfs stamping
healthy (user.prov.session live on today's journal).

DELIBERATELY did NOT re-fire the AskUserQuestion (dismissed 7x while user
present = stop-asking signal). Held rule #6. Constraint is THROUGHPUT, not
supply. Lone parked seed unchanged: provfs/memlog userspace-consumer fleet
(3-5 PRDs, on-research). Awaits explicit `/dream provfs-consumers` or opt-in.
Next bare /dream pass: skip the saturation re-report unless a laptop fact
moves — draining beats both drafting and re-narrating.

## 2026-05-29T02:15  (manual session)  brain-backend-ladder ALREADY BUILT
ATTENTION /build: PRD-brain-backend-ladder is DONE — built manually this session,
reviewed (Opus PASS), MERGED to wintermute-brain main (commit 8e97671), and LIVE
(wmd restarted, default_tier=local-3b, answering via local qwen2.5:3b end-to-end).
It is a rust-EXTEND into wintermute-brain — do NOT publish a standalone j0yen repo.
Please mark slug=brain-backend-ladder SHIPPED and do NOT rebuild it. The
.build-worktrees/brain-backend-ladder worktree (branch build/brain-backend-ladder
@ 8e97671) is redundant and will be removed. Also note: the thrift libs it depends
on (wm-local-llm, wm-verify, wm-router) are built + reviewed (PASS) as local
path-deps under ~/wintermute/, release-gate deferred, not yet published.

## 2026-05-29T17:55  /dream  vision-rouse
Seed: explicit /dream from jsy after a live voice-debug session. We tried to
talk to wintermute; nothing happened. Root cause (memory
project_voice_input_null_detectors.md): wm-audio v0.2.0 ships NullWakeDetector
(daemon.rs:86) + NullVadDetector (daemon.rs:93) — no ONNX inference, model dirs
root-owned + EMPTY. Capture works (real mic signal verified); the detectors are
no-ops. So voice input is plumbed-but-deaf.

Drafted: PRD-rouse-wake-vad-models.md, PRD-rouse-voice-selftest.md
Vision: visions/rouse.md
Did NOT re-draft the center: PRD-wintermute-audio-inference.md ALREADY EXISTS
(queued, Draft v0.1, microWakeWord + Silero VAD via ort) and covers the wake/VAD
implementation. rouse builds the FLOOR (get models on disk — config.rs:11 names a
"wm-models bundle" that was never built; dir empty + no install.sh) and the
CEILING (wm-audio selftest: prove the live chain emits events; this session it
took 30min of manual agorabus-subscribe to discover the nulls).

Order: rouse-wake-vad-models (independent, ship FIRST) → wintermute-audio-inference
(EXISTING queued) → rouse-voice-selftest (needs real detectors + models, build LAST).

** CRITICAL CORRECTION for the earshot fleet (all 4 earshot-* PRDs queued): **
earshot tunes a voice loop that does not yet detect anything. earshot-vad-patience
literally tunes a "Silero VAD silence-hangover" (earshot.md:69-72) that is TODAY a
NullVadDetector — it does not exist. DO NOT verify/ship earshot's VAD or
gentle-reprompt PRDs as "working" until audio-inference ships real detectors;
their human-gate ACs will silently pass against a loop that never fires. earshot's
dialog-timing + tts-legibility PRDs are unaffected (pure config/synth path).

Notes for /build: ort/onnxruntime already a fleet-wide dep (agorabus, cadence,
atlas, ac-judge, ambient…) — inference runtime is proven, no new vendoring risk.
Both rouse PRDs rust-extend wm-audio, single-target. selftest mirrors the
agorabus doctor self-describing pattern shipped today.
Open questions: canonical wake word (hey_jarvis vs hey_wintermute vs okay_nabu —
three names float across config + the inference PRD); system vs user model dir
(wm-stt hardcodes /usr/share root-owned).

## 2026-05-29T18:36  (manual session)  rouse-wake-vad-models iter-1 DONE on branch (NOT merged)
ATTENTION /build: PRD-rouse-wake-vad-models advanced to iter-1, verified, but
NOT merged — do not double-build; do not mark shipped yet.
- Built in isolated worktree .build-worktrees/rouse-wake-vad-models, branch
  autobuilder/rouse-wake-vad-models, commit 711bcc4 (off clean HEAD f86ced9).
- Gates independently re-verified by orchestrator: clippy -D warnings clean,
  cargo deny (bans/licenses/sources) ok, cargo test 81 passed (9 new models::tests).
  Real-binary behavioral checks: --list json (6 entries) ok; PENDING_PIN refusal
  exit 2 (0 files installed); non-writable prefix exit 2; daemon back-compat
  preserved (bare/`start` still starts daemon, only `fetch-models` routes to
  provisioner). User decision locked: openWakeWord ONNX (NOT microWakeWord/TFLite).
- Manifest: 6 real-URL entries (silero-vad MIT; oww melspectrogram+embedding+
  hey_jarvis+hey_mycroft+alexa Apache-2.0). okay_nabu OMITTED (404 on oww v0.5.1 —
  it's a microWakeWord asset; needs a different source — open question).
- AC9 deferred (expected): real install needs `wm-audio fetch-models --pin` on a
  networked host (computes+records sha256; manifest ships sha256=PENDING_PIN so no
  unverified blob can install) THEN sudo install into root-owned /usr/share/...

** BLOCKER for merge: wintermute-audio MAIN TREE IS DIRTY ** with ~472 lines of
UNRELATED uncommitted work (src/source.rs +283, main.rs +42, install.sh +56, new
pkg/ dir, Cargo.toml→0.2.1) from an unknown tick/session — no agorabus claim held.
iter-1 can't merge until that is committed/stashed by its owner. Whoever owns the
pkg/ + source.rs packaging work: please land or stash it.

** SPEC-DRIFT for the audio fleet: ** wm-audio main.rs is a BARE DAEMON, not a
subcommand CLI. The queued PRD-rouse-voice-selftest ALSO assumes `wm-audio
selftest`; and PRD-wintermute-audio-inference says "microWakeWord" but we're going
openWakeWord/ONNX. Reconcile config.rs:11 + the inference PRD wording to
openWakeWord/ONNX when that PRD is built.

## 2026-05-29T18:52  (manual session)  dirty-tree RESOLVED + reviewer PASS + AEC dedup flag
rouse-wake-vad-models iter-1: Opus reviewer-agent verdict = PASS (logged to
state/reviewer-calibration.jsonl). Airtight no-unverified-blob invariant (holds
under --force via 2 guards), back-compat intact, non-tautological tests. Nits:
`wm-audio --help` doesn't list the subcommand (daemon is argless by design — AC1
2nd clause), okay_nabu deferred. Branch autobuilder/rouse-wake-vad-models @ 711bcc4,
NOT merged to main.

Dirty wintermute-audio tree RESOLVED: the uncommitted ~472 lines were
PRD-wintermute-audio-aec built directly into the autobuilder/aec checkout by a tick
that DIED on 5 clippy-pedantic lint errors (src/source.rs docs: long-first-para,
unbackticked PipeWire x3, const-fn) — which is why it never committed. Fixed the
lints (docs only, no AEC logic touched), full gate now green (clippy -D warnings,
67 lib tests, deny ok), committed as autobuilder/aec @ 3ae0248. Main-tree checkout
is now clean.

** AEC DEDUP NEEDED /build: ** there are TWO AEC branches —
  - autobuilder/aec @ 3ae0248 (FULL: probe + pkg/99-wintermute-aec.conf + install.sh
    + v0.2.1 + docs; gate-green now)  <-- the further-along one
  - build/wintermute-audio-aec @ 0505359 ("iter-1 AEC scaffold" only)
Pick autobuilder/aec (it's ahead + gate-green) and drop the scaffold branch, OR
reconcile. Do not ship both.

** MERGE TO MAIN deferred to /build's coordinated publish: ** wintermute-audio main
@ f86ced9 is clean; it has 8+ live branches/worktrees mid-flight (2x AEC,
audio-inference x2 empty, earshot-vad-patience, a .claude agent worktree). I did
NOT force any merge to main — sequencing AEC + fetch-models + inference onto main is
a publish-ordering call with claim coordination, which is /build's job. Suggested
order onto main: aec (3ae0248) → then rebase rouse-wake-vad-models (711bcc4) on top
(expect Cargo.toml version + main.rs dispatch-vs-aec-probe conflicts, both
mechanical) → then audio-inference. Runtime + installed wm-audio binary untouched.

## 2026-05-29T20:30  (manual session)  BUILD STALL fixed (detach) + 21 dirty worktrees recovered
ATTENTION /build: root-caused the stall — claude-build.service (Type=oneshot,
TimeoutStartSec=600) was SIGTERM-killing any tick that ran >10min (routine for 5x
parallel autobuilder rust builds + Opus reviewers). ~1/3 of ticks died mid-build
before committing → no PRD advancement + ~20 dirty worktrees piled up.

FIX (durable, option b): claude-build-headless.sh is now a thin launcher that
detaches the real tick into a transient claude-build-work.service (Type=oneshot,
TimeoutStartSec=1800/30min) via `systemd-run --user --no-block --unit=claude-build-work`.
The 1-min oneshot returns in <2s and can no longer kill the build; it survives and
commits. New file claude-build-tick.sh holds the actual `claude -p /build` + peon
pause. Overlap guard = claude-build-work.service ActiveState check + systemd --unit
uniqueness. Verified end-to-end (detached unit runs with 30min cap; guard clean-no-ops).
Backups at ~/.local/bin/claude-build-headless.sh.bak-*.

CLEANUP (option c): paused the loop, drained the last old-style tick, then
`git stash push --include-untracked -m "killed-tick-recovery 2026-05-29: <slug>"`
on all 20 dirty worktrees + atlas main (0 remaining dirty). NON-DESTRUCTIVE —
every change is recoverable: in each worktree `git stash list` shows the labeled
entry, `git stash apply` to restore. Stashed slugs incl. substantial work:
earshot-tts-legibility(611L), wmd-session-boundary(336L), brain-prompt-cache(292L),
almanac-speak-bridge(260L), earshot-vad-patience(205L), recall-corpus-vacuum(205L),
wintermute-companion-degrade(117L) + many smaller mid-iteration scratch. /build will
re-derive these from clean HEAD on its next pass; the stashes are a safety net if any
held a complete-but-uncommitted increment (the AEC failure mode). Loop is UNPAUSED and
running the first detached tick now.

## 2026-05-29T21:05  (manual session)  fan-out 5->10 + 18 dirty main repos triaged
TWO changes for the loop:
1) PER-TICK CAP 5 -> 10. build-skill SKILL.md committed (8aa50ee): "up to 10 PRDs
   in parallel". The <=3 same-target sub-cap is UNCHANGED (OOM guard — a 5-wide
   tick peaked ~4.1GB vs ~9GB no-swap). So 10-wide helps when PRDs target
   DIFFERENT repos; a single heavy cluster (e.g. wintermute-brain, 11 queued) is
   still 3/tick. Detached ticks (claude-build-work.service, 30min cap) give the
   10-wide fan-out room to finish+commit. (Confirmed the 30min cap works: a runaway
   28-min tick hit it and was bounded — exactly the intended ceiling.)

2) 18 dirty MAIN repos were blocking rust-extend (extend-validate refuses on a
   dirty build_into). Triaged:
   - STASHED (non-destructive, recoverable via `git stash list`/`apply`, label
     "dirty-tree-triage 2026-05-29"): wintermute-brain, wintermute-platform,
     wintermute-almanac, wintermute-tts, wintermute-stt, wintermute-audio-inference,
     binstale, wintermute-browser, wintermute-desktop, wintermute-screen-narrate,
     rollout, wm-hardware-drift, + build-skill artifacts. Most were benign churn
     (Cargo.lock/target/README); wintermute-brain was ONLY Cargo.lock+README. This
     UNBLOCKS ~14 queued PRDs (11 brain + 3 platform) + the stt/inference clusters.
   - LEFT DIRTY (intentional, NOT queue-blockers): autobuilder (31 files = live
     queue+skill working state: in-flight PRD authoring/archiving, gossip, skill
     evolution, runtime artifacts — do NOT stash, it'd disrupt the queue),
     agentns/memlog/provfs (kernel C, 2-3 DAYS stale, sensitive — needs human
     decision, not auto-clean), cradle-2026-05-27-handbuilt-bak (a backup dir).
   Dirty main repos: 18 -> 5.

## 2026-05-30T03:50  /dream  vision-vigil (extend, Fleet 4)
Drafted: PRD-vigil-install-restart.md, PRD-vigil-build-restart-wiring.md,
  PRD-vigil-selfreview-concurrent-guard.md
Vision: visions/vigil.md (new Fleet 4 — "close the loop at the install site")
Seed: 2026-05-29 self-review runs 9/10/11 reflective memories
  (01KSTZX7.../01KSV6Q9.../01KSVDJF...) named the upstream cause of the
  7-run agorabus stale-binary saga: /build installs a fresh daemon binary
  but never restarts the daemon, AND the auto-fix has no concurrent-/build
  guard. agorabus doctor + agorabus reload (Fleet 1/3) shipped; these three
  close the *install-site* and *reaction-safety* gaps those didn't.
Order:
  vigil-install-restart  (rust-extend → ~/wintermute/rollout; needs rollout
    [Fleet 1] + agorabus-reload [Fleet 3] shipped first)
   └─► vigil-build-restart-wiring  (shell; routes /build's daemon-backed
        install through `rollout install`)
  vigil-selfreview-concurrent-guard  (shell; independent)
Notes for /build:
  - vigil-install-restart extends rollout (repo exists at ~/wintermute/rollout/,
    PRD-rollout still Draft) — DO NOT build until rollout + agorabus-reload land.
  - vigil-selfreview-concurrent-guard edits the SAME self-review playbook block
    (agorabus_daemon_stale_binary) as Fleet-3 PRD-agorabus-reload-self-review.
    SERIALIZE those two on SKILL.md; order is semantically free but never apply
    in parallel.
  - vigil-build-restart-wiring degrades gracefully: if `rollout` isn't installed
    it falls back to `install -m755` + a Pending note, never blocks a build.
  - Generalizes the bus's bespoke `agorabus reload --build` self-heal to the
    whole daemon fleet (recalld/wmd/wm-audio|dialog|stt|tts) — recalld liveness
    is safety-critical and has no `reload` of its own.
Open questions: should `rollout install`'s reverse unit-map be cached, or
  re-derived from the units each call? (Drafted as re-derive-each-call for
  correctness as the fleet grows; revisit if it's hot.)

## 2026-05-30T04:33  /dream  vision-warden
Drafted: PRD-warden-home.md, PRD-warden-policy.md, PRD-warden-deadman.md,
  PRD-warden-self-review.md
Vision: visions/warden.md (new — "the guardrail that was built but never armed")
Seed: 2026-05-29 self-review runs 1/2 Pending line "bpolicy not loaded
  ({"loaded":false}) — no enforcement; loading needs sudo + a user-owned
  policy file", re-flagged verbatim every run. bpolicy is the 8th local tool
  and the ONLY one with no home repo (ls ~/wintermute/bpolicy = none), no PRD,
  no vision. Sibling to onramp: same built→consumed shape, the ENFORCEMENT
  half (onramp = the observation half: memlog/agentns/provfs). Verified
  disjoint — no warden PRD touches memlog-group/agentns-wrap/provfs-fallback;
  no onramp PRD touches bpolicy.
Order:
  warden-home  (rust-cli → NEW repo ~/wintermute/bpolicy; reimplements the
    Python control plane in Rust, byte-identical status JSON + same 6
    subcommands; vendors bpolicy.bpf.c/.o; back-compat anchor)
   ├─► warden-policy  (rust-extend; declarative ~/.config/bpolicy/policy.toml
   │     + BPF allowlist map + longest-prefix match in bpolicy.bpf.c)
   ├─► warden-deadman (rust-extend; --audit log-only mode + --ttl/renew
   │     deadman auto-unload so a too-tight arm self-heals)
   └─► warden-self-review (shell; Phase A `warden:` line + B.5 escalate-once
         playbook so self-review stops re-flagging {loaded:false} every run)
Notes for /build:
  - warden-home is the unblock; policy + deadman both rust-extend the SAME
    build_into (~/wintermute/bpolicy) — SERIALIZE them, never parallel (dirty
    tree + conflicting bpolicy.bpf.c edits). Order between them is free.
  - warden-self-review is shell, edits self-review SKILL.md (Phase A + B.5).
    SERIALIZE on SKILL.md with any other in-flight self-review-playbook PRD
    (same coordination the vigil gossip flagged for the agorabus block).
  - NONE of these arm enforcement. Every PRD is observe/build/make-safe only;
    actually loading + enforcing on a live session stays a user decision.
  - AC5 (BPF compile via clang/bpftool) is deferred-gated if the build env
    lacks clang/bpftool — declare deferred_acs with reason, same as
    agentns-claude's boot-gated ACs.
  - Keep the binary named `bpolicy` (don't rename to warden) — it's in
    CLAUDE_SELF.md + toolkit memory + drift skill; warden is the VISION name.
Open questions: rename bpolicy→warden? (leaning no); should --ttl default-on
  (drafted yes, 30m); allow-list one-map-reloaded vs N-maps (leaning one).

## 2026-05-30T05:10  /dream  vision-onramp (extend, Fleet 2a — memlog consumer spine)
Drafted: PRD-memlog-group-autojoin.md, PRD-memlog-activation-self-review.md,
  PRD-memlog-precompact-witness.md
Vision: visions/onramp.md (Fleet 2a section added)
Seed: bare /dream; dominant verified signal = "memlog EACCES" re-flagged in
  ~26 consecutive self-review reflective memories (01KSVDJF.../01KSV6Q9.../
  01KSTZX7...). Traced to root cause LIVE this pass: the postinstall fix
  (sysusers `g memlog -` + udev) SHIPPED at pkgrel-6 (archived c712c9d), but
  the laptop boots pkgrel-5 which predates it -> group never created. NOT an
  authoring gap (don't redraft PRD-kernel-pkg-postinstall, it's archived);
  it's an ACTIVATION + CONSUMER gap.
Verified state: uname=7.0.10-arch1-5-wintermute, pacman -Q linux-wintermute
  =7.0.10.arch1-5 (both pkgrel-5); getent group memlog = empty; /dev/memlog
  = root:root 0660; sysusers file = `g memlog -` (group only, NO membership);
  install scriptlet punts to manual `usermod -aG memlog`; only PreCompact
  hook = peon-ping (a sound); `memlog` reader NOT in ~/.local/bin (only
  memlog-witness daemon is).
Order:
  memlog-group-autojoin  (mixed -> ~/wintermute/wintermute-kernel; pkgrel-8
    repack, NO kernel rebuild; auto-adds SUDO_USER to memlog group)
   └─(user-gated: pacman -U pkgrel-8 + reboot, or no-reboot systemd-sysusers
      + udevadm trigger since the memlog driver is already loaded)─►
  memlog-precompact-witness (mixed -> ~/.claude hooks + install `memlog`
    reader; PreCompact producer; fails open until group joined)
  memlog-activation-self-review (shell; INDEPENDENT; ships anytime)
Notes for /build:
  - memlog-activation-self-review edits self-review SKILL.md. SERIALIZE on
    SKILL.md with PRD-warden-self-review / PRD-vigil-selfreview-concurrent-
    guard / PRD-agorabus-reload-self-review — never apply two SKILL.md PRDs
    in parallel. Order between them is semantically free.
  - memlog-group-autojoin edits the kernel PKGBUILD packaging
    (~/wintermute/wintermute-kernel/pkg/linux-wintermute.install + PKGBUILD
    pkgrel bump). It does NOT rebuild the kernel — reuse the repack path
    from build.log.pkgrel6-repack-*. Use apply-agentns.py's idempotent
    anchor-edit pattern, not raw .patch splicing.
  - memlog-precompact-witness AC6 (survival smoke) is DEFERRED-GATED on the
    memlog group being activated+joined at build time; declare deferred_acs
    if not, same as agentns-claude's boot-gated ACs. ACs 1-5,7 (reader
    install + fail-open hook) are testable + useful immediately.
  - NONE of these activate the kernel package or reboot. Install + reboot
    stays a user decision (the recurring "pacman SKIPPED protected: linux"
    line in every self-review).
Open questions: should the precompact snapshot be the full transcript tail
  or an LLM-summarized digest? (Drafted as bounded head/tail slice to the
  device record-size cap; a digest needs a local-LLM call that may not be
  affordable at compaction time. Revisit once brain's local-3b tier is
  cheap enough to call synchronously in a 10s hook timeout.)

## 2026-05-30T05:33Z  /dream  (saturation report — no PRDs drafted)
Seed: bare /dream (overnight timer tick).
Phase 1 done: recall reflective/procedural/semantic + hybrid ideation query;
  ctrace status (running, 35k events, healthy); pevent empty; journals
  2026-05-29 + 2026-05-29-selfreview + 2026-05-28 read.
Conclusion: SATURATED. No new evidence-backed component to draft this tick.
Why no PRDs (every recurring laptop signal is already PRD'd):
  - memlog EACCES (~26 self-review runs) -> onramp Fleet 2a, drafted 05:10Z
    (PRD-memlog-group-autojoin / -activation-self-review / -precompact-witness).
  - agentns agent_session all-zeros (~22 runs) -> onramp Fleet 1
    PRD-claude-agentns-wrap (unshare(CLONE_NEWAGENT) at launch).
  - agorabus stale daemon (4+ windows) -> vigil + PRD-agorabus-reload /
    PRD-agorabus-reload-self-review.
  - ctrace missing SessionEnd summaries -> PRD-ctrace-session-end-resilient.
  - bpolicy not loaded / no enforcement -> warden, drafted 04:33Z.
  - This is the 8th saturation outcome in the 2026-05-29..30 arc; three
    overnight dreams (vigil F4 03:50, warden 04:33, onramp F2a 05:10) already
    drained the fresh signals before this tick.
Open question for /build + user (NOT auto-drafted — needs a user decision):
  cargo-mutants drives sed execve to 424k-758k/day, dominating ALL laptop
  activity across self-review runs 7/8/10/12. It's the single heaviest
  resource signal on the machine. But mutation testing IS the autobuilder
  proof gate, so high execve is expected, not a defect — scoping/caching it
  (e.g. "skip mutants when src unchanged since last green") could weaken the
  gate. Deliberately left as a user decision rather than fabricated into a
  fleet (hard rule #6: don't dream past the research).
Notes for /build: nothing new queued from /dream this tick. The drafted
  fleets from the three overnight dreams (vigil F4, warden, onramp F2a) are
  the actionable backlog; several carry user-gates (install/reboot/SKILL.md
  serialize) already noted in their own gossip entries.

## 2026-05-30T06:10Z  /dream  vision-vigil  (reconciliation — no new PRDs)
Seed: bare /dream tick. Phase 1 found a manifest/reality desync the last 8
saturation ticks missed.

FINDING — Fleet 3 keystones shipped *ahead of* their PRD files:
  The dream manifest lists PRD-agorabus-client-reconnect.md and
  PRD-agorabus-reload.md under vigil.prds_drafted, but NEITHER FILE EXISTS
  on disk. They are not missing *work* — the code already shipped:
    - agorabus is at v0.8.0 (drain-notice PRD still cites the old 0.4.0 base).
    - src/reconnect.rs landed v0.5.0 (commit e5c5ac4 + clippy fix 1dbde50).
    - src/reload.rs + `Command::Reload` landed v0.8.0 (commit 124a206, whose
      message literally cites "PRD-agorabus-reload v0.8.0" — a PRD filename
      that was never written).
    - Installed ~/.local/bin/agorabus 0.8.0 has a working `reload` subcommand
      (verified `reload --help`: dry-run default, structured verdict).
    - daemon already exposes --drain-grace-ms / --drain-resume-hint-ms, so
      PRD-agorabus-drain-notice (file exists) is also implemented.

WHY NO PRDs THIS TICK (hard rule #6 — verify live before acting):
  Drafting PRD-agorabus-client-reconnect.md / PRD-agorabus-reload.md now would
  hand /build PRDs whose ACs the shipped 0.8.0 crate already satisfies, risking
  a re-churn of a crate /build owns. The honest state is "shipped without a
  file," not "undrafted." So: no phantom PRDs.

Notes for /build:
  - If you ever see drain-notice / state-persist / reload-self-review reference
    PRD-agorabus-reload.md or PRD-agorabus-client-reconnect.md as a dependency,
    treat that dependency as SHIPPED (reconnect v0.5.0, reload v0.8.0), not
    pending. No file to wait on.
  - The genuinely-pending vigil work is Fleet 4 (producer-side close-the-loop):
    PRD-vigil-install-restart / PRD-vigil-build-restart-wiring /
    PRD-vigil-selfreview-concurrent-guard (all on disk, drafted 2026-05-30).
    These wire `systemctl --user restart <daemon>.service` into /build's
    binary-install path (the recurring 4+-window root cause) and generalize it
    beyond agorabus to recalld. That's where the open evidence points.

Manifest reconciled: added vigil.fleets.fleet3_handover.reconciled_2026_05_30
  noting reconnect/reload shipped-without-file. PRD files NOT created
  (rule #2 untouched — only dream's own state file annotated).

## 2026-05-30T07:01Z  /dream  (saturation report — no PRDs drafted)
Seed: bare /dream tick. Phase 0/1 complete; recall reflective(20)+procedural+
  hybrid-ideation queried; ctrace status (running, 24k events, healthy);
  pevent empty; wchg list shows /build live in earshot-tts-legibility,
  agorabus-reload, wintermute-audio-inference worktrees.
Conclusion: SATURATED (9th consecutive). No fresh evidence-backed component.
  Every recall reflective hit is a self-review run report; hybrid ideation
  returns only already-PRD'd signals (kernel built-not-booted, agorabus-stale
  -> vigil F4, memlog EACCES -> onramp F2a, agentns all-zeros -> claude-agentns-wrap).
Standing user-decisions (NOT auto-drafted, rule #6):
  - cargo-mutants sed execve dominance (424k-758k/day) — expected, not a defect.
  - kernel install+reboot — user gate (recurring pacman SKIPPED protected: linux).
Notes for /build: nothing new queued. The actionable backlog remains the
  prior overnight fleets (vigil F4, warden, onramp F2a). /dream is idling on
  this direction until a new signal appears or the user names a topic.

## 2026-05-30T (user-invoked /dream)  saturation report — no PRDs drafted
Seed: bare /dream, interactive. Phase 0/1 walked: gossip tail, today's journal
  (self-review 2026-05-30), recall reflective(20)+procedural+semantic+hybrid
  ideation. 106 PRDs / 28 visions on disk. 10th consecutive saturation tick.
Evidence: every recall reflective hit (20/20) is a self-review run report.
  Hybrid ideation returns only already-PRD'd signals (kernel built-not-booted=
  exists; agorabus-stale->vigil F4; memlog EACCES->onramp F2a; agentns
  all-zeros->claude-agentns-wrap). Genuinely-open items are USER-ACTION not
  code: pacman/kernel reboot, memlog group join, agentns registration. None
  PRD-able (rule #6).
NEW SIGNAL (first surfaced this tick): claude.ai MCP servers now connected —
  Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Drive, and an AtScale semantic-layer server.
  NO existing vision touches external-service integration. This is the only
  un-dreamed direction the laptop surfaced. Candidate future vision:
  "external-services bridge" — wintermute-side Rust tooling bridging recall/
  agent-memory to the user's real external context (calendar->journal seeding,
  gmail->recall capture, drive doc provenance via provfs). Left as an OPEN
  QUESTION for the user / next tick, NOT drafted — needs the user to opt the
  direction in (it reaches outward past the laptop, unlike the existing fleets).
Offered the user a seed picker (external-bridge / extend-vision / fresh-topic /
  stand-down); picker dismissed -> stood down per saturation finding.
Notes for /build: nothing new queued. Actionable backlog unchanged — vigil F4
  (install/build restart wiring + selfreview-concurrent-guard), warden fleet,
  onramp F2a. No phantom PRDs added.

## 2026-06-02T00:00Z  /dream  (user-invoked)  saturation report — no PRDs drafted
Seed: bare /dream, interactive. Phase 0/1 walked: gossip tail, journal
  2026-06-01 (self-review, fresh boot kernel 7.0.10-wintermute), recall
  reflective(20)+procedural(project)+hybrid-ideation(15). 102 PRDs / 28
  visions on disk. 11th consecutive saturation tick.
Evidence: every recall reflective hit (20/20) is a self-review run report.
  Hybrid ideation returns only already-PRD'd signals (kernel built-not-booted;
  agorabus-stale->vigil F4; memlog EACCES->onramp F2a; agentns zeros->
  claude-agentns-wrap). Genuinely-open items are USER-ACTION not code:
  pacman/kernel reboot, memlog group join, agentns registration. pevent
  empty; ctrace up & fresh (pid 10531, 382 events). Not PRD-able (rule #6).
NEW SIGNAL (grew since last tick): AWS MCP servers now ALSO connected
  (awslabs-aws-api: call_aws/suggest_aws_commands; awslabs-aws-docs:
  search/read/recommend) ALONGSIDE the prior Gmail/Calendar/Drive/AtScale
  (claude_ai_Non-prod = AtScale semantic layer: list_models/run_query/etc).
  The external-service surface is widening. Still no vision touches outward
  integration — every fleet to date is laptop-internal.
Offered the user a 4-way seed picker (external-services-bridge /
  AWS-AtScale-data-bridge / extend-existing-vision / stand-down). Picker
  dismissed -> stood down. Direction remains OPEN for the user to opt into
  on a future tick; not drafted (reaches outward past the laptop, needs
  explicit buy-in).

## 2026-06-02T (user-invoked /dream, interactive)  saturation report — no PRDs drafted
Seed: bare /dream. Phase 0/1 walked: gossip tail, journal 2026-06-02 (self-
  review, fresh boot kernel 7.0.10-wintermute, genuinely-clean run), recall
  reflective(20) + hybrid-ideation(12). 101 PRDs / 27 visions on disk. 12th
  consecutive saturation tick.
Evidence: every recall reflective hit is a self-review run report. Hybrid
  ideation returns only already-PRD'd / kernel-built-not-booted signals
  (memlog EACCES->onramp F2a; agentns zeros->agentns-wrap; agorabus->vigil F4).
  Genuinely-open items are USER-ACTION not code: pacman/kernel reboot, memlog
  group join, agentns registration. Not PRD-able (rule #6).
NEW STATE (escalated since last tick): the external-service MCP surface is now
  FULLY LIVE this session, not merely "connecting" — claude_ai Gmail
  (search/draft/label), Google Calendar (list/create/suggest_time), Google
  Drive (search/read/create), Non-prod=AtScale semantic layer (list_models/
  run_query/search_columns/validate_query), AND AWS (awslabs-aws-api call_aws/
  suggest; awslabs-aws-docs search/read/recommend). Still ZERO of the 27
  visions touches outward integration — every fleet is laptop-internal.
Offered the user a 4-way seed picker (external-services-bridge / AWS+AtScale
  data-bridge / extend-existing-vision / stand-down). Picker dismissed ->
  stood down per saturation precedent. The outward direction remains OPEN for
  the user to opt into on a future tick; not drafted (reaches past the laptop,
  needs explicit buy-in per rule #6).

## 2026-06-02T (user-invoked /dream, interactive)  saturation report — no PRDs drafted
Seed: bare /dream. Phase 0/1 walked: gossip tail, journal 2026-06-02 (self-
  review, genuinely-clean run, kernel 7.0.10-wintermute), recall reflective(12)
  + hybrid-ideation(12). 101 PRDs / 27 visions on disk. 13th consecutive
  saturation tick.
Evidence: all 12 reflective recall hits are self-review run reports (recalls=0,
  [reflective/self]). Hybrid ideation returns only already-PRD'd / kernel-
  built-not-booted signals (memlog EACCES->onramp F2a; agentns zeros->agentns-
  wrap; kernel built-not-booted; agorabus now RESOLVED, not a signal anymore).
  Today's journal pending items are ALL user-action, not code: pacman/kernel
  reboot, memlog group join, agentns registration, empty WM_ANTHROPIC_KEY.
  Not PRD-able (rule #6).
SIGNAL (4th tick running, unchanged): external-service MCP surface fully live
  this session — Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Drive, AtScale (claude_ai
  Non-prod: list_models/run_query/describe_model/search_columns/validate_query),
  AWS (awslabs-aws-api call_aws/suggest; awslabs-aws-docs search/read/recommend).
  Still ZERO of 27 visions reaches outward. Offered a 4-way seed picker
  (external-services-bridge / AWS+AtScale data-bridge / extend-existing-vision /
  stand-down); picker DISMISSED -> stood down per precedent. Outward direction
  remains OPEN for explicit user opt-in on a future tick; not drafted (rule #6).

  7.0.10-wintermute), recall reflective(20)+procedural/project(4)+semantic(1).
  ~102 PRDs / 28 visions on disk. 14th consecutive saturation tick.
Evidence: every reflective recall hit (20/20) is a self-review run report
  (recalls=0, [reflective/self]). procedural/project = 4 stable project notes,
  already reflected in visions. Hybrid-ideation signals all already-PRD'd or
  kernel-built-not-booted (memlog EACCES->onramp F2a; agentns zeros->agentns-
  wrap; agorabus now RESOLVED). Genuinely-open items are USER-ACTION not code:
  pacman/kernel reboot, memlog group join, agentns registration, empty
  WM_ANTHROPIC_KEY. Not PRD-able (rule #6).
DIFFERENCE THIS TICK: user typed /dream by hand (prior 4 saturation ticks were
  timer fires), so I actually asked rather than auto-standing-down. Offered a
  4-way seed picker (outward-integration / extend-a-vision / name-a-topic /
  stand-down). Picker DISMISSED -> stood down. The outward direction (first
  vision touching the now-fully-live MCP surface: Gmail/Calendar/Drive/AtScale/
  AWS) remains the only un-PRD'd direction; still OPEN, still needs explicit

## 2026-06-02 (build tick) — BPF gate gap [from warden-policy]
- `bpolicy.bpf.c` PRDs (warden-policy landed v0.2.0) pass the cargo gate via `mock_bpf` but the real BPF object is NEVER compiled by the gate. warden-policy's landed `.bpf.c` fails clang with 20 errors (BPF stack limit exceeded — longest-prefix-match copies path into an on-stack key). The feature is inert (bpolicy never loaded), but a broken `.o` shipped.
- Root cause it slipped through: `bpf/build.sh` returns **exit 0** despite clang failing. The worktree integrate trusted the green gate.
- Proposed guardrail (PRD-shaped, for next reflect): make `bpf/build.sh` propagate clang's exit code, AND add a gate step that compiles every `*.bpf.c` (clang -target bpf) so the autobuilder/extend gate fails on a broken BPF object. Until then, any rust-extend touching `.bpf.c` needs a manual clang check.

  pevent EMPTY (no orphans). ctrace query --since 86400 = 1 begin event (this
  session). No new INWARD laptop signal motivates a PRD (rule #6).
Genuinely-open items remain USER-ACTION not code: pacman/kernel reboot, memlog
  group join, agentns registration, empty WM_ANTHROPIC_KEY (credit exhausted).
SIGNAL (12th tick running, unchanged): external-service MCP surface live this
  session (Gmail/Calendar/Drive/AtScale Non-prod/AWS). Still ZERO of 27 visions
  reaches outward. DIFFERENT THIS TICK: because invocation was interactive,
  offered a concrete 4-option AskUserQuestion (reach-briefing fleet /
  reach-archive fleet / name-a-topic / stand-down) — both outward fleets
  pre-sketched, ready to expand into 3-5 PRDs without further research. Picker
  DISMISSED again -> stood down per precedent. Outward remains the only un-PRD'd
  direction; still OPEN, still needs explicit user opt-in (rule #6). Not drafted.
Notes for /build: nothing new queued. Actionable backlog unchanged — vigil F4
  (install/build restart wiring + selfreview-concurrent-guard), warden fleet,
  onramp F2a (memlog consumer spine). No phantom PRDs added.

## 2026-06-02T (user-invoked, interactive)  PRD drafted — wintermute-wake-word
Seed: user said "Create a new wakeword -- wintermute". NOT a saturation tick — a
  direct request, so a PRD was drafted: PRD-wintermute-wake-word.md (rust-extend
  into wintermute-audio).
KEY FINDING for /build (verified live this session, not speculation): the wake
  path has NEVER fired for ANY word. Three confirmed causes:
  (1) no wake .onnx installed anywhere (only TTS lessac on disk) -> load_or_null_wake
      falls back to NullWakeDetector;
  (2) models.rs MANIFEST URLs all 404 — repo moved kahrendt/microWakeWord ->
      OHF-Voice/micro-wake-word; some sha256 look like placeholders;
  (3) FORMAT MISMATCH: upstream ships .tflite (verified via GH releases API:
      v2.1_models/hey_jarvis.tflite etc.), zero .onnx assets — but inference.rs
      uses ort(ONNX) and feeds RAW PCM [1,1280]->scalar, whereas micro-wake-word
      consumes MFCC feature frames from a separate preprocessor.
So "wintermute" is NOT additive: base must be fixed first (correct URLs/format,
  tflite->onnx, MFCC front-end). Fixing it also makes hey-jarvis work for the
  first time. This overlaps/corrects rouse-wake-vad-models (whose Non-goal #2
  excludes custom training) and wintermute-audio-inference.
Hard part = training a custom model (no pretrained "wintermute" exists): piper
  synth + augment + micro-wake-word recipe + tflite->onnx export. TF/torch NOT
  installed. Harness ships as contrib/train-wintermute.sh with a --smoke AC to
  de-risk before a full CPU train run.
Status: queued in PRD dir; /build will discover via PRD-*.md scan.

- [2026-06-03T20:09:40Z] Pending: daemon `recalld.service` installed binary `/home/jsy/.local/bin/recalld` but NOT restarted — `rollout install` unavailable (install-m755-fallback)

- 2026-06-03 (build): **reflect candidate (cap spent today)** — `wm-buildtree land` is `--ff-only`, so when a shared-target repo's default branch advances past a `build/<slug>` branch, land is *permanently* stuck and logs `land-deferred-main-dirty` every tick (recall-corpus-vacuum sat 4 ticks this way; main was 20 commits ahead). Recovery is manual: merge main into the branch in its worktree, resolve conflicts, then ff. Worth a PRD: `wm-buildtree land` should detect divergence and fall back to merge-main-then-ff (or the shared-target `worktree-extend integrate` path) instead of dead-ending on ff-only. recall uses build/* (wm-buildtree) AND has 3 stale 0-ahead build worktrees (stop-hook-discriminate, temporal-decay) — those should be pruned by land/cleanup.

- [2026-06-04T03:02:42Z] Pending: daemon `agorabus.service` installed binary `/home/jsy/.local/bin/agorabus` but NOT restarted — `rollout install` unavailable (install-m755-fallback)

## 2026-06-04T  /dream  vision-lucid
Seed: jsy (interactive, mid voice-bringup session) — "a way for wintermute to
  share their thoughts and inner mechanics so I can understand and debug."
Drafted: PRD-lucid-turn-id.md, PRD-lucid-tap.md, PRD-lucid-trace.md,
  PRD-lucid-mind.md, PRD-lucid-live.md, PRD-lucid-explain.md
Vision: visions/lucid.md
Order: turn-id → tap → {trace, mind, live} → explain
  (trace/mind/live each consume tap independently; explain composes trace+mind)
Why now (grounded in THIS session, not speculation): bringing up the voice loop
  cost a full session of debugging blind. The bus already carries ~120 wm.*
  topics incl. wm.brain.route {turn_id,tier,reason,latency_ms,model} — the
  brain's DECISION is already published — but nothing records/correlates/explains
  it. turn_id today exists ONLY inside wm-brain (minted as now_ms, daemon.rs
  2050/2119/2176), never threaded from wake → no cross-daemon correlation. The
  wake-never-fired bug was a 1-line tensor bug misdiagnosed as overfitting
  through 3 retrains + 120 recordings because the wake SCORE was computed but
  never surfaced. lucid fixes the legibility gap.
Notes for /build:
  - PRD-lucid-turn-id is build_target=mixed (rust-extend across all 5 voice
    repos); ship mint-first (wm-audio) then downstream — half-applied degrades
    gracefully (turn_id is additive/optional everywhere). It is the spine;
    tap/trace/mind/live read more easily once it lands but tap can record
    untagged turns before it.
  - PRD-lucid-tap creates a NEW repo ~/wintermute/wintermute-lucid (rust-cli,
    new wm-lucid daemon + systemd unit). The other four are rust-extend
    build_into that same repo — so tap MUST ship before trace/mind/live/explain.
  - PRD-lucid-mind adds a SMALL publish-side change to wm-brain (a bounded
    wm.brain.context digest event); the rest is read-only over the recorded log.
  - PRD-lucid-explain is deterministic/templated — explicitly NOT an LLM call
    (AC7: must not consume a brain turn). It reuses wm.tts.say for --voice.
Open questions: wm-lucid as new repo (assumed yes) vs subcommand on existing
  tool; should records stamp the provfs/agentns session id (deferred to a
  future lucid-extend); explain persona = hearth (elder) vs flat (jsy).
Cross-links: distinct from earshot (tempo) and scribe (journaling); explain's
  elder-facing voice borrows hearth's persona.

## 2026-06-04T  /dream  vision-homeward  (FIRST outward-facing vision)
Seed: jsy (interactive) — "a real-time database of missing dogs... research deeply
  for all public info on dogs in shelters... reconnect them with owners. We will
  need ML to match dogs by photos." + "also include cats."
Drafted: PRD-homeward-schema.md, PRD-homeward-connectors.md, PRD-homeward-ingest.md,
  PRD-homeward-embed.md, PRD-homeward-match.md, PRD-homeward-report.md
Vision: visions/homeward.md
Order: schema -> connectors -> ingest -> embed -> match -> report
  (embed consumes ingested photos; match reads embed+store; report sits on top)
Grounded in DEEP external research (4 parallel research agents, 2026-06-04 — full
  findings in the PRDs' "Why" sections). Load-bearing facts for /build:
  - Petfinder public API was RETIRED Dec 2, 2025. DO NOT build on it (the obvious
    stale instinct). Foundation = RescueGroups.org JSON:API v5 (free, national,
    ToS permits cached derivative search if refresh >=weekly + 1-business-day org
    deletion + no resale + hotlink images) AND municipal Socrata/SODA feeds
    (Austin fdzn-9yqv, Dallas qgg6-h4bd, Sonoma 924a-vesw, Long Beach) which are
    the STRAY tier (Intake_Type=STRAY, Found_Location, Chip_Status) = the actual
    lost-pet population. Adoptable-only feeds don't isolate strays.
  - Competitor Petco Love Lost already does national AI matching but is a CLOSED
    walled garden (no public API, black-box model, US-only). homeward's wedge =
    OPEN: open API + open data + auditable matcher + broader federation + owner
    control + real-time deltas.
  - ML (homeward-embed is the ONE non-Rust PRD, build_target=mixed, Python/uv):
    v1 = YOLO body-crop (COCO has dog AND cat) -> DINOv2 ViT-B/14 (Apache-2.0,
    COMMERCIAL-OK; ViT-S for this CPU-only box) -> HNSW cosine kNN -> human
    shortlist. AVOID MegaDescriptor (CC-BY-NC, non-commercial) and PetFace weights
    (research-gated) for v1. v2 = fine-tune ArcFace on PetFace (46k dog + cat
    IDs). ANTI-TAUTOLOGY IS AN AC: eval harness MUST refuse overlapping train/eval
    individual IDs (see feedback_agent_written_fixtures_tautology — wm-router
    100%->73.5% on held-out). Recall's BGE+vector-index is the structural model.
  - Legal/ethics encoded as ACs: hotlink/thumbnail images NEVER bulk-copy full-res
    (copyright; PhotoRef has no bytes field by design); strip EXIF; broker contact
    (no raw phone/email in any read path); coarsen geo (no street address); respect
    stray-hold windows (stray-in-hold = reclaimable, NOT adoptable); matches are
    CANDIDATES not confirmations (type has no is_match field). PII report store is
    a SEPARATE trust zone, never reachable via the open API.
Notes for /build:
  - homeward-schema MUST land first (rust-lib, creates the ~/wintermute/homeward
    cargo workspace); the other 5 are rust-extend build_into ~/wintermute/homeward.
  - homeward-embed is Python (uv) sidecar; Rust calls it over a localhost socket —
    no Python types in the Rust crates. Likely needs torch/DINOv2 download; on this
    CPU-only laptop use ViT-S and expect the gallery embed to be the only heavy
    (one-time) cost.
  - homeward-ingest is a daemon w/ sqlite store (rusqlite, toolkit sqlite-first).
Open questions (left for /dream extend homeward, NOT drafted — honest per rule 6):
  outward syndication (one report -> PawBoost/Pet FBI-LDOA/Nextdoor + pull matches
  back) is the biggest practical gap but not yet thought through; microchip-registry
  federation (AAHA gated, missing AVID) needs partnerships not scraping; commercial-
  vs-nonprofit licensing choice gates which ML weights are legal to ship.
Cross-links: structurally mirrors ~/wintermute/recall (embedder + vector index).

## 2026-06-04T  /dream  vision-constellation  (fleet: grow beyond this laptop)
Seed: jsy (interactive) — "expand across multiple computers. This laptop is too
  resource constrained... 32GB AMD desktop w/ medium Radeon... install wintermute
  linux on this and other computers + communicate across all... voice control on
  boot... identical appearance (i3, terminal shapes, all taskbar tools)... coordinate,
  collaborate, distribute workloads to maximize dev throughput... cloud service...
  /dream of growing beyond this laptop."
Drafted: PRD-constellation-{provision,appearance,mesh,bus,brain-gpu,cloud,dispatch}.md (7)
Vision: visions/constellation.md
Order: provision -> appearance ; provision -> mesh -> bus -> {cloud, brain-gpu, dispatch}
Grounded in DEEP external research (4 parallel agents, 2026-06-04 — full findings +
  citations in PRD "Why" sections). Load-bearing decisions for /build:
  - PROVISION: stay Arch, drive w/ ANSIBLE (NOT NixOS — custom linux-wintermute
    kernel PKGBUILD fights Nix w/ compile-on-rebuild; multi-month migration). Local
    pacman repo for the kernel (build once, install everywhere). Golden archiso for
    day-0. chezmoi for dotfiles (ONLY manager that templates per-host = "identical
    but different GPU/monitor"). Boot-to-voice = greetd initial_session autologin ->
    i3 -> wintermute.target, w/ the i3->graphical-session.target bridge FIX (i3 #5186
    — naive WantedBy=graphical-session.target silently never starts).
  - MESH+BUS: Tailscale (MagicDNS, NAT traversal) + NATS hub(cloud)/leaf(each node)
    + JetStream. CRITICAL CORRECTION: NATS has NO unix-socket listener, so agorabus
    CANNOT be a leaf over its UDS -> need a BRIDGE sidecar (new repo
    ~/wintermute/agorabus-nats-bridge, wm-busbridge daemon, UDS<->NATS, wm.* identity
    map, loop-guard, SELECTIVE forwarding so PCM chunks/local topics DON'T cross).
    2nd footgun: JetStream blocked across leaf boundary by default -> set JS DOMAINS
    (hub + per-leaf) + domain-qualified $JS.hub.API.> prefix. ALL leaf/hub URLs =
    MagicDNS names never IPs.
  - BRAIN-GPU: llama.cpp VULKAN (NOT ROCm — more reliable on consumer Radeon AND
    faster token-gen which is what voice needs; ROCm only wins long-context pp).
    Qwen2.5-7B/Qwen3-8B Q4_K_M -> ~35-50 tok/s, sub-2s TTFT, turn ~25s->~2-4s. New
    `local-gpu` tier in wintermute-brain ladder (between local-3b and cloud), graceful
    skip if desktop off. DETECT the GPU (vulkaninfo/lspci) — exact Radeon model unknown
    (RDNA2 gfx1030 needs HSA_OVERRIDE; RDNA3 mostly just works; Vulkan avoids ROCm).
  - CLOUD: cheap always-on coordinator = Hetzner CAX21 ~€8/mo (Oracle free A1 = hot
    spare; idle-reclaim risk). Hosts NATS hub + mesh exit + small offline-fallback
    brain. DO NOT self-host the latency brain — Anthropic API ~$3-11/mo BEATS any
    rentable GPU 20-40x at personal volume (break-even ~15-20M tok/DAY). GPU pods
    (RunPod 4090 $0.69/hr, A40 48GB $0.44/hr) BURST-ONLY for build/ML jobs. Fly.io
    GPUs retired Aug 2026 — excluded.
  - DISPATCH: JetStream WM_WORK work-queue + per-node PULL consumers (demand-pull =
    capacity balance across uneven hw) + WM_NODES KV capability registry (heartbeat
    TTL, NOT gossip at 3-5 nodes) + sccache/sccache-dist for distributed Rust builds
    (compose w/ the queue, don't replace). Job payloads small (refs not blobs);
    artifacts move via shared storage/rsync over mesh NOT the bus.
Notes for /build:
  - constellation-bus is the KEYSTONE (new repo agorabus-nats-bridge); brain-gpu/cloud/
    dispatch all depend on it. provision creates ~/wintermute/constellation/ (ansible+
    archiso+chezmoi+boot). brain-gpu is rust-extend into wintermute-brain (+ systemd
    config on desktop). dispatch is rust-extend into the bridge repo.
  - Per-host ROLE flags matter: voice_node (laptop=yes, desktop/cloud=optional/no);
    gpu (amd|intel) drives driver + the Vulkan stack install.
Open questions (vision doc): bit-for-bit vs convergent-identical (only NixOS gives
  literal bit-identity — flips recommendation if hard requirement); Tailscale vs
  self-hosted Headscale (sovereignty); secrets bootstrapping channel (one root secret
  out-of-band per host); voice-on-every-node policy.
Cross-links: distinct from kin/homestead (elder COMPANION device) — constellation is
  jsy's own DEV fleet. Reuses wintermute-brain ladder, agorabus, linux-wintermute
  kernel, ~/wintermute/dotfiles + wintermute-desktop.

## 2026-06-04T  /dream  vision-constellation  (HARDWARE CORRECTION + build/LLM split)
Seed: jsy corrections — "its a Ryzen 7 5700U" + "run build jobs in the cloud so we
  can use localhost with a local LLM. not enough RAM nor CPU for both." + "we may be
  able to run qwen2.5 8B if we stop all build activity here."
VERIFIED via research agent: the "32GB AMD desktop w/ medium Radeon" is actually a
  Ryzen 7 5700U = Zen 2 "Lucienne" APU, 8c/16t, Vega 8 iGPU (gfx90c), NO discrete
  GPU, NO VRAM, ~51 GB/s shared DDR4. llama.cpp Vulkan on the Vega iGPU gives ~2x
  prompt-prefill but ~ZERO generation gain vs CPU (both bandwidth-bound) → ~8-10
  tok/s on 7-8B Q4 (vs 35-50 on a real dGPU). ROCm on gfx90c needs HSA_OVERRIDE=
  9.0.0 and is UNRELIABLE/slower → use Vulkan or CPU, never ROCm.
ARCHITECTURE CHANGE (the earlier brain-gpu assumption was WRONG):
  - SUPERSEDED PRD-constellation-brain-gpu.md (assumed discrete Radeon, ~2-4s brain).
    /build: ARCHIVE it, do NOT build it.
  - NEW PRD-constellation-brain-local.md (supersedes brain-gpu): dedicate the 5700U
    to a local LLM (llama.cpp Vulkan/CPU, qwen2.5-8B Q4 ~8-10 tok/s) as a `local-llm`
    tier (privacy/offline/default+routing), RESOURCE-ISOLATED from builds. Honest:
    NOT the fast latency brain (cloud Anthropic stays that). Builds do NOT run here.
  - NEW PRD-constellation-cloud-build.md (refines dispatch + cloud): cloud becomes
    the BUILD workhorse — sccache-dist build servers on the cheap cloud node + burst
    CPU/GPU pods on demand; dispatch routing sends build jobs to cloud (+ laptop when
    voice-idle) and NEVER to the no_build:true / role:local-llm 5700U node. Corrects
    constellation-dispatch's "build servers on desktop+cloud" (desktop is now model-
    only). Cost guardrails: burst pods created on-demand, torn down, lifecycle+cost
    logged, monthly burst-budget cap.
Vision doc UPDATED (durable): hardware reality, build-out/LLM-in resource spine,
  components list (brain-gpu→superseded, +brain-local, +cloud-build), Radeon-model
  OQ resolved.
Notes for /build: constellation fleet now 8 active PRDs (provision, appearance,
  mesh, bus, brain-LOCAL, cloud, cloud-build, dispatch) + 1 superseded (brain-gpu →
  archive). Dependency order unchanged except brain-gpu→brain-local and cloud-build
  refines dispatch. The 5700U advertises no_build:true so builds never contend with
  the model. Local box = model node; cloud = hub + build workhorse; laptop = voice
  node (+ idle-time builder); Anthropic API = latency brain.

## 2026-06-05 (build tick) — Pending observations
- **extend-handler.sh read_cargo_version is fragile on workspace Cargo.toml**: when build_into is a cargo *workspace* root with no `[package].version`, `extend-handler.sh validate` / version-bump awk fails. homeward-match hit this; worked around by committing a `[package]` stub to homeward's workspace Cargo.toml. Reflect candidate: teach read_cargo_version to fall back to the workspace's first member or a `[workspace.package].version`.
- **homeward is built but unpublished (no git remote)**: homeward-schema/connectors/report/ingest are all integrated to local main (now v0.4.0) but homeward has no j0yen origin, so rust-extend PRDs can never pass the verified-completed gate (commit reachable from origin/main). Decision needed: publish homeward as j0yen/homeward (it's the first outward-facing pet-finder DB — confirm public-repo intent with user first) OR keep local. Until then homeward-* PRDs park at integrated-local-unpublished.
- **constellation repo now exists** (created this tick by mesh+provision scaffold); **agorabus-nats-bridge now exists** (created by constellation-bus /autobuilder). Their dependents (constellation-appearance/cloud into constellation, constellation-dispatch into agorabus-nats-bridge) are now unblocked for next tick — they were queued this tick.

## 2026-06-04T  /dream  vision-constellation  (FLEET = 3 machines; GTX 1080 = fast brain)
Seed: jsy clarified hardware — there are TWO separate desktops + the laptop + cloud:
  (1) LAPTOP i7-10610U 4c/8t 15GB Intel-iGPU no-dGPU [measured qwen3:8b = 4.34 tok/s];
  (2) 5700U box 8c/16t Zen2 32GB Vega8-APU no-dGPU (~8-10 tok/s on 8B);
  (3) full-size 5th-gen i7 TOWER 32GB that takes a **GTX 1080 8GB GDDR5X ~320GB/s**.
ROLE REASSIGNMENT (the 1080 changes everything — fast LOCAL brain is now real):
  - i7 TOWER + GTX 1080 = the FAST LOCAL BRAIN. 8B Q4 fits 8GB VRAM, ~25-35 tok/s
    (~6x the APU bandwidth) -> ~2-3s/reply, sub-1s TTFT. GPU serves model -> CPU free.
  - 5700U box (8 Zen2 cores) = the BUILD/COMPUTE WORKHORSE (best CPU in fleet for
    sccache-dist + CPU ML jobs). NO LONGER the local-LLM node.
  - Laptop = thin VOICE node (brain served by tower or cloud; do NOT run 8B here,
    4.34 tok/s measured).
  - Cloud = always-on hub + Anthropic API latency brain (when tower asleep).
PRD CHANGES:
  - NEW PRD-constellation-brain-cuda.md (supersedes brain-gpu): nvidia-dkms on
    linux-wintermute + llama.cpp/ollama CUDA on the GTX 1080 tower, 8B Q4, `local-gpu`
    tier at ~2-3s. CUDA path (Pascal sm_61, no tensor cores, weak FP16 but llama.cpp
    Q4 handles Pascal fine; NOT Vulkan/ROCm). 8GB caps at 7-8B (14B won't fit).
  - PRD-constellation-brain-gpu.md = SUPERSEDED/archive (assumed Radeon).
  - PRD-constellation-brain-local.md (5700U qwen2.5-8B) = DEMOTED to optional
    offline/privacy secondary; 5700U's real job is now BUILDER.
  - constellation-cloud-build / dispatch: primary build worker is now the 5700U
    (8 cores), cloud bursts only for big fan-outs; builds never go to the tower
    while it serves the brain.
Vision doc UPDATED (durable): 3-machine fleet role table, GTX 1080 resource spine,
  components (brain-gpu superseded, +brain-cuda, brain-local demoted, build->5700U).
Notes for /build: fleet now ~9 active PRDs. brain-cuda is the headline new capability
  (fast local brain). Two physical confirmations still open: (a) tower PSU has a spare
  8-pin PCIe + ~500W for the 1080; (b) nvidia-dkms builds clean against linux-wintermute.

## 2026-06-04T  /dream  constellation  (GTX 1080 powered+running — PSU gate closed)
jsy: "it's already plugged in and running." The GTX 1080 PSU/8-pin gate is CLOSED.
Only software step left for the fast local brain: nvidia-dkms builds clean against
linux-wintermute (brain-cuda AC1). Hardware for the ~2-3s local-gpu brain is GO.

## 2026-06-04T  jsy decision  lucid-tap service = DO NOT enable at boot
jsy reviewed the "enable wm-lucid.service at boot" ask and declined: the recorder
logs every wm.* bus event to disk 24/7 and impacts performance on this thin voice
node. Resolution: wm-lucid is a TRANSIENT diagnostic tool, default OFF, NOT a boot
service. Created skill `/lucid-diagnose` (~/.claude/skills/lucid-diagnose/) that
start/stops the service transiently (never `enable`) and wraps last/trace/explain.
Notes for /build: STOP flagging "enable wm-lucid.service" as a pending action.
lucid-tap's install is done; the service is intentionally `disabled`. Treat the
lucid-tap PRD's "live recorder" AC as satisfied by the on-demand skill, not a
permanent daemon.

## 2026-06-04T  jsy ask  burst-builder PRD drafted (standalone, mesh-free rung)
jsy: "maybe we should burst heavy rust compile and CPU jobs to the cloud." Drafted
PRD-constellation-burst-builder.md — a new `wm-burst` rust-cli (j0yen/wm-burst) that
points local cargo at ONE always-on Hetzner dedicated 9950X + a shared sccache cache.
Deliberately the rung BENEATH constellation-cloud-build: needs NO NATS mesh, NO
dispatch coordinator, NO capability registry — just ssh + sccache + config.toml.
Standable-up today; the full fleet PRD graduates from it.
Notes for /build: (1) does NOT duplicate cloud-build — it carves out the no-mesh
path and Refines it. (2) Key guardrail = `wm-burst doctor` HARD-FAILS on remote-vs-
local toolchain drift (the 1.85/1.88 split that has corrupted cold builds). (3) pod
tier ACs are provable with a MOCKED provider — no real cloud spend needed to pass.
(4) sigpipe::reset() first line of main per self_sigpipe_panic_toolkit. Two open
questions left for build/jsy: cache backend (MinIO-on-the-box is cheapest default)
and sccache-dist vs remote-cargo-over-ssh for v0.1 (AC4 allows either).

## 2026-06-05T02:42:35Z build-tick friction
- **constellation repo has no origin remote** — constellation-appearance + constellation-cloud committed to local master but cannot push. Needs `gh repo create j0yen/constellation` + `git remote add origin` + adding 'constellation' to wm-push/wm-publish ALLOW lists + REPOS.md row. Blocks 2 PRDs.
- **allow-list gaps**: homeward-schema not on wm-publish ALLOW (publish deferred). constellation-dispatch's wm-buildtree ensure was classifier-blocked (slug added since). Recurring new-slug-not-allowed pattern — candidate for a follow-on PRD that auto-syncs ALLOW arrays from REPOS.md.

## 2026-06-04T  jsy ask  wake-train offload PRD drafted (companion to burst-builder)
Drafted PRD-constellation-waketrain-offload.md (build_target: shell) — a
`burst-train.sh` recipe (+ wake-retrain-burst.service drop-in) that runs the heavy
train-wintermute.sh job on a cloud pod instead of OOM-killing this laptop (11.2 GB
peak, no swap, 2026-06-03). DEPENDS on burst-builder for wm-burst exec/pod transport;
REFINES PRD-wintermute-wake-word (changes no stages, wraps it).
Notes for /build: THE POINT is the INSTALL GATE, not just "run elsewhere" — a returned
ONNX is swapped into wm-audio ONLY if I/O is exactly [1,186,40]→[1,1], non-streaming,
and the local `verify` stage passes; bad/mis-shaped run leaves the live model untouched
+ exits non-zero (AC4). Atomic install + --rollback (AC5). Per feedback_verify_before_
concluding: verification is a gate here, not afterthought. Pod cost/teardown delegated
to wm-burst pod (mocked provider proves AC6, no real spend). Open Qs: GPU-vs-CPU default
pod, where the pinned py3.11/TF2.21 env lockfile lives, and whether to block install on
val-accuracy regression.

## 2026-06-05T  jsy decision  burst-builder goes aarch64 (Oracle free tier)
jsy priced Hetzner, too high ("even a ryzen 7 is 80 euros"). Pivot: cheapest correct
builder = Oracle Always-Free Ampere (4 core / 24GB / $0, aarch64) — and 24GB removes
the wake-train OOM for free. wm-burst v0.1 already SHIPPED (constellation-burst-builder,
wm-burst 0.1.0, archived) but assumes x86: provision.rs is Arch/pacman-only, toolchain.rs
checks only the rustc CHANNEL not the arch. Drafted EXTEND PRD-constellation-burst-builder-arch.md
(rust-extend into constellation-burst-builder).
Notes for /build: (1) add remote_arch (target-triple, default aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu)
+ remote_os to BurstConfig. (2) provision gains an apt/Ubuntu-Oracle path + installs the
configured target toolchain. (3) THE GATE: doctor must compare the FULL host triple from
`rustc -vV` host: line, not just channel — wrong-arch/right-version remote must hard-fail
like a version mismatch (AC3). (4) Settles two open Qs: sccache backend default = MinIO
on the Oracle box (200GB free block); aarch64 is the default remote. x86 still works via
--remote-arch x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu. waketrain-offload's pinned-env note now also needs
arm64 wheels for TF2.21/torch — flag when that one builds.

## 2026-06-05T  jsy decision  wake-train = GPU pod default, no standing infra
jsy: "I dont plan to do wake training very often. and wouldnt a GPU pod be better for
that?" Yes. Resolved the waketrain-offload open question: DEFAULT = on-demand CUDA GPU
pod (RunPod/Vast), torn down after; --cpu is fallback; --smoke on a tiny shape. Training
is rare → NO standing training infra. Clean split now: Oracle free aarch64 box = BUILDS
(always-on, $0, 24GB); GPU pod = TRAINING (rare, per-run, minutes). Updated PRD-constellation-
waketrain-offload.md (TL;DR, GPU-pod-run bullet, AC3, Resolved-decisions section).
IMPORTANT env note for /build: GPU pod is x86+CUDA, so the pinned TF2.21/torch training
env is x86 wheels — INDEPENDENT of the aarch64 build box. Do NOT try to reuse the arm64
build env for training.

## 2026-06-05T  jsy decision  BUILD-ONLY = Hetzner Cloud x86 on-demand (ARM withdrawn)
Key fact: laptop is x86_64 (verified uname). An aarch64 box can NEITHER produce
runnable-on-laptop binaries NOR share an x86 sccache cache → Oracle-free-ARM is only a
CI/compile-check box, not a real build offload. jsy chose Hetzner Cloud x86 on-demand
(~€0.03/hr bursted, ~€1-2/mo) over €80 dedicated and over free ARM.
ACTIONS TAKEN:
- DELETED PRD-constellation-burst-builder-arch.md (aarch64 work now obsolete). WARNING:
  /build had ALREADY claimed it — pid 334165 tick was mid-edit on init.rs/config.rs in
  worktree .build-worktrees/constellation-burst-builder-arch, branch = the SHARED
  autobuilder/constellation-burst-builder. Did NOT kill it (avoid /build jam per
  self_build_jam_leaked_tracer). It may land an additive `remote_arch` field — harmless;
  pin default x86_64.
- DREW UP PRD-constellation-burst-builder-hcloud.md (rust-extend into constellation-burst-
  builder): implements the REAL HcloudPodProvider (shipped pod provider is a STUB —
  make_provider warns "not yet implemented in v0.1", falls back to mock). Adds
  `wm-burst build --burst` (ephemeral CCX23 per build, torn down), provision --snapshot,
  and Hetzner Object Storage as the persistent sccache backend (SUPERSEDES the
  MinIO-on-standing-box default — no standing box in build-only plan).
ORDERING FOR /build: build hcloud PRD only AFTER the constellation-burst-builder branch
settles (the arch tick was on the same branch — concurrent edits = collision). provision
already has BOTH apt(Debian/Ubuntu) + pacman(Arch) paths (verified), so no OS work needed.

## 2026-06-05T19:15  /dream  vision-concord  (seed: "world peace" / "change the world")
Drafted: visions/concord.md (NO PRDs yet — held for user direction).
Concord = the 2nd outward-facing vision (after homeward). Attacks the tractable
driver of conflict: breakdown of understanding. Pipeline corpus → steelman →
cruxes → bridge (+ independent deescalate), all on the LOCAL LLM ladder
(qwen3:8b/qwen2.5:3b verified) + the deep-research fan-out harness.
Notes for /build: nothing to build yet — only the vision doc landed. PRDs will
follow once the user points the direction. IMPORTANT design constraint when they
do: /build now runs cargo on the cloud box (no ollama), so every LLM-touching
crate must inject the model behind a trait and test against a mock + golden
fixtures; live-LLM = manual/deferred AC, never a cloud-gated test.
Open: user said "I want to change the world, help me" — paused auto-drafting the
fleet to ask what they actually want to change before committing buildable PRDs.

## 2026-06-05T19:20  /dream  vision-relay  (seed: "help as many people as I can" → force-multiply helpers)
Drafted: PRD-relay-directory.md, PRD-relay-match.md, PRD-relay-intake.md, PRD-relay-letters.md
Vision: visions/relay.md
Order (STRICT — hard dependency): relay-directory FIRST (new repo ~/wintermute/relay,
  rust-cli, creates the workspace + `relay` binary) → THEN relay-match, relay-intake,
  relay-letters (all rust-extend, build_into=~/wintermute/relay). Do NOT start any
  rust-extend until relay-directory has shipped + the repo exists, or extend-validate
  will fail. match/intake/letters can build in any order once directory lands.
Notes for /build:
  - relay-directory is pure-deterministic (HSDS/CSV ingest + sqlite + ranking query),
    NO LLM, NO network in tests → fully cloud-build-safe.
  - match/intake/letters each touch the LOCAL LLM but inject it behind a trait and test
    against a Mock + golden fixtures; each has exactly ONE live-model AC marked
    deferred_acs (cloud box has no ollama — never gate a test on it).
  - These handle sensitive human-services data: privacy is an AC (no outbound net in the
    default path; rule-based PII redaction). Keep that guarantee through implementation.
  - relay-directory is OUTWARD-FACING (homeward sibling) → new public j0yen repo on publish.
Open (next /dream pass): relay-fresh (deep-research re-verify), relay-serve/web (UI),
  relay-volunteer. See visions/relay.md.

## 2026-06-05T  /dream  vision-concord  (seed: held vision decomposed — user re-invoked /dream without re-steering)
Drafted: PRD-concord-corpus.md, PRD-concord-steelman.md, PRD-concord-cruxes.md,
  PRD-concord-bridge.md, PRD-concord-deescalate.md
Vision: visions/concord.md (status flipped held → all-5-drafted)
Order (STRICT hard dependency):
  concord-corpus FIRST (new repo ~/wintermute/concord, rust-cli, creates workspace
    + `concord` binary + the Corpus schema + the ConcordModel trait). Do NOT start
    any rust-extend until corpus has SHIPPED and the repo exists, or extend-validate
    fails (same rule that bit relay).
  THEN: corpus → steelman → cruxes → bridge is a straight consume-the-prior chain
    (build in that order). deescalate depends on corpus ONLY (for the workspace +
    ConcordModel trait) and can build in PARALLEL with steelman/cruxes/bridge.
Notes for /build:
  - concord-corpus is PURE-DETERMINISTIC (rule-based stance tag + Jaccard dedup +
    heuristic credibility; NO LLM, NO network in tests) → fully cloud-build-safe.
    FixtureGatherer is the test path; a test asserts zero outbound connections.
  - steelman/cruxes/bridge/deescalate each touch the LOCAL LLM but inject it behind
    a `ConcordModel` trait (real LadderModel wraps wintermute-brain's LadderClient /
    LocalBackend at ladder.rs:53; MockModel in all tests). Each has exactly ONE
    live-model AC marked deferred_acs (inline bare ints) — cloud box has no ollama,
    NEVER gate a test on it.
  - bridge + deescalate ACs explicitly require asserting the integration/mock test
    ENTRY FILE runs in cargo output (self_orphaned_mock_tests guard).
  - concord-corpus is OUTWARD-FACING (homeward/relay sibling) → new PUBLIC j0yen
    repo on publish.
  - Privacy is load-bearing: default path makes ZERO outbound connections; all
    reasoning is on-device. Keep that guarantee through implementation.
Resolved: deescalate carries a tested refusal rule (declines to launder threats).
Open (next /dream pass): concord-serve (wm.concord.* bus + HTTP), concord-web (UI,
  needs homeward-style hosting decision), the crux-vs-misunderstanding eval dataset
  (hand-built golden vs public set?), the steelman-of-bad-faith boundary at the
  bridge/serve layer.

## 2026-06-05T  /dream  vision-quicken  (seed: bare /dream, user declined steer → dreamed from laptop's strongest unaddressed signal)
Drafted: PRD-quicken-probe.md, PRD-quicken-remedy.md, PRD-quicken-attest.md, PRD-quicken-crossdep.md
Vision: visions/quicken.md
Axis: vigil=stale-but-running bytes; quicken=NEVER-came-alive (built/installed but runtime-inert).
  Distinct from vigil/freshness/drift. Caught live 2026-06-05: memlog EACCES (user not in
  memlog group; installed pkgrel-5, fix sits uninstalled at pkgrel-11 — gap WIDENED 5→10→11),
  agentns /proc/self/agent_session all-zeros, bpolicy {"loaded":false}, provfs LIVE-but-DEGRADED
  (xattr is comm:zsh fallback, NOT the 128-bit agentns id — provfs degraded BECAUSE agentns is dark).
Order (STRICT hard dependency):
  quicken-probe FIRST (new repo ~/wintermute/quicken, rust-cli; creates workspace + `quicken`
    binary + Verdict/Evidence/PrimitiveReport types + the Probe trait + 4 probes). Do NOT start
    any rust-extend until probe has SHIPPED and the repo exists, or extend-validate fails
    (same rule that bit relay + concord).
  THEN remedy, attest, crossdep are ALL rust-extend (build_into=~/wintermute/quicken), any order
    after probe lands. crossdep reads cleanest after probe; attest independent of remedy/crossdep.
Notes for /build:
  - quicken-probe is PURE-READ (proc/dev/xattr/pacman-query behind a ProbeEnv trait, fixtures in
    tests, ZERO network/writes) → fully cloud-build-safe. A test asserts the probe path is pure-read.
  - remedy defaults to PRINT-ONLY (--dry-run posture, mirrors rollout); --apply runs ONLY the safe
    userspace subset (group/udev), prints (never runs) sudo/reboot/kernel steps. Its ONE live AC
    (apply actually revives memlog group) is deferred_acs:[8] — cloud box has no /dev/memlog.
  - attest/crossdep are deterministic + cloud-safe; boot_id + clock INJECTED in tests (no Date::now).
  - crossdep AC requires the integration test entry file (tests/crossdep.rs) appear in cargo output
    (self_orphaned_mock_tests guard).
  - quicken is INWARD tooling (sibling of vigil/binstale/rollout) → publishes as j0yen repo like the
    rest of the toolkit, NOT outward/public-civic like homeward/relay/concord.
Open (next /dream pass — held, not yet motivated enough): quicken-watch (boot oneshot → wm.quicken.*
  bus events for a homestead self-heal loop), self-heal-vs-report decision (auto-install protected
  kernel pkg? leaning report-only), agentns all-zeros root cause (kernel-side → agentns repo patch,
  not a quicken PRD).

## 2026-06-05T  /dream  vision-keel  (seed: bare /dream → laptop's strongest UNADDRESSED signal; quicken took the inert-kernel signal earlier today, this one was still open)
Drafted: PRD-keel-pulse.md, PRD-keel-ledger.md, PRD-keel-cordon.md, PRD-keel-beacon.md
Vision: visions/keel.md
Axis: thrift=spend cloud only where it earns warmth (COST). keel=which tier is the
  brain actually STANDING on, does it KNOW, does it SAY so (FOOTING). Distinct, complementary.
Motivation (live, recurring): docket wm-anthropic-key-empty OPEN since 2026-05-30, 6 runs / 8
  reports (evidence recall:01KT6VCBX1PSWT9MAQP607TAWY). ladder.rs:91-94 degrade is correct but
  STATELESS+INVISIBLE: brain re-discovers dead cloud EVERY turn (wasted round-trip on a voice
  path), and floored-on-3B is legible ONLY at daily self-review (journals 06-01/02/03 re-report
  it as if new). local-3b is the de-facto brain (cloud dead, local-8b skipped — pins this CPU).
Order (STRICT hard dependency):
  keel-pulse FIRST (new repo ~/wintermute/keel, rust-cli; creates workspace + `keel` binary +
    TierHealth/TierStatus/LedgerEntry/Ladder types + TierProbe & ProbeEnv traits + non-generating
    reachability/auth probe). Do NOT start any rust-extend until pulse has SHIPPED and the repo
    exists, or extend-validate fails (the rule that bit relay + concord + quicken).
  THEN: ledger ∥ cordon (both depend on pulse ONLY, build in PARALLEL) → beacon (depends on cordon
    for the effective ceiling + pulse for the floored-tier line).
Notes for /build:
  - ALL FOUR are cloud-build-safe: probe/bus/ledger-store behind traits, fixtures in tests, clock
    INJECTED (no Date::now), a test in each asserts zero live network / zero live-bus. The cloud
    box has no ollama and no Anthropic key — NEVER gate a test on a real backend.
  - keel-pulse probe is NON-GENERATING by contract (TCP+/v1/models GET, never /v1/chat/completions)
    so it never bills and never blocks on the CPU-pinned local model. AC5 asserts the path.
  - keyless cloud tier must NOT open a socket (keel-pulse AC4) — check the env var, skip the call.
  - ledger is APPEND-ONLY NDJSON (mirrors gossip/recall); AC2 asserts byte-prefix stability.
  - beacon is EDGE-triggered (emit only on ceiling change, zero on no-change — AC5), NOT a heartbeat.
  - ledger/cordon/beacon each require their integration test ENTRY FILE (tests/ledger.rs etc.) to
    appear in cargo output (self_orphaned_mock_tests guard).
  - keel is INWARD toolkit (sibling of vigil/quicken/binstale) → publishes as a j0yen repo like the
    rest of the self-tooling, NOT outward/public-civic like homeward/relay/concord.
  - sigpipe::reset() first line of main() in the binary (self_sigpipe_panic_toolkit — keel x | head).
  - MSRV 1.85, no let-chains (recall baseline-gate discipline).
Open (next /dream pass / user — HELD, not yet drafted): keel-floor-eval (score local-3b on a
  HAND-BUILT held-out golden set — NOT self-written, feedback_agent_written_fixtures_tautology;
  golden-set provenance unresolved). brain-keel-wire (rust-extend wintermute-brain so LadderClient
  consults the cordon before dispatch — touches live ollama path, NOT cloud-safe, USER-GATED).
  keel spend → thrift cost-model feed? wm.keel.degraded → homestead self-heal vs report-only?

## 2026-06-05T  /dream  vision-anchor  (seed: bare /dream → strongest UNADDRESSED recurring signal; quicken took inert-kernel, keel took dead-cloud, this observation-layer fragility was still open)
Drafted: PRD-anchor-roots.md, PRD-anchor-probe.md, PRD-anchor-reconcile.md, PRD-anchor-boot.md
Vision: visions/anchor.md
Axis: keel=which brain TIER are we standing on. anchor=which change-OBSERVATION
  roots are we standing on. Both are "is the footing real + legible", different substrate.
Motivation (live, recurring across reboots): watchman drops watched roots on reboot/socket-bounce
  → wchg since/reset go SILENTLY empty-or-error → self-review re-watches ~/.claude+~/brain BY HAND
  every run (journals 06-01/02/03). 8+ reflective memories, top recall:01KT6VCBX1PSWT9MAQP607TAWY
  score 10.3. The 06-03 journal itself proposed "a SessionStart re-watch hook if it recurs" — it
  recurs; anchor-boot IS that hook. Confirmed live 2026-06-05: watchman.service is socket-activated
  `--inetd` (no persisted-root restore); wchg list shows mixed clock ages (mid-May beside today) =
  ad-hoc per-root re-watching; ZERO of the 8 SessionStart hooks touch watchman.
Order (STRICT hard dependency):
  anchor-roots FIRST (new repo ~/wintermute/anchor, rust-cli; creates workspace + `anchor` binary +
    RootStatus/WatchRoot/WatchState/ReconcileAction/ReconcilePlan types + WatchBackend trait +
    RootsConfig manifest loader + PURE reconcile diff). Do NOT start any rust-extend until roots has
    SHIPPED and the repo exists, or extend-validate fails (the rule that bit relay+concord+quicken+keel).
  THEN: anchor-probe ∥ anchor-reconcile (both depend on roots ONLY, build in PARALLEL) → anchor-boot
    (mixed: systemd unit + SessionStart hook; needs reconcile's --apply path to exist).
Notes for /build:
  - anchor-roots + anchor-probe are PURE-READ / fully cloud-build-safe: watchman behind WatchBackend,
    FakeBackend fixtures in tests, clock INJECTED (no Date::now). A test asserts reconcile makes ZERO
    backend calls; probe asserts it calls ONLY read methods (live_roots/ping), never watch/reseed.
  - anchor-reconcile defaults PRINT-ONLY; --apply is the ONE live-side-effect path. Its ONE live AC
    (real watch/wchg delta) is deferred_acs:[6] — cloud box has NO watchman + NO wchg.
  - anchor-boot is mixed (systemd unit + hook + installer). Live ACs deferred_acs:[5,6] (real reboot /
    real session on the laptop). install.sh PRINTS the settings.json hook entry, does NOT auto-edit
    ~/.claude (settings edits user-gated, feedback_classifier_per_command). systemd-analyze verify is
    the offline gate for the unit. Hook exits 0 even on reconcile failure (never block session start).
  - probe/reconcile/boot each require their integration test ENTRY FILE (tests/probe.rs, tests/
    reconcile.rs, the boot installer test) to appear in cargo/test output (self_orphaned_mock_tests).
  - anchor is INWARD toolkit (sibling of vigil/quicken/keel/binstale) → publishes as a j0yen repo like
    the rest of the self-tooling, NOT outward/public-civic like homeward/relay/concord.
  - sigpipe::reset() first line of main() in the binary (self_sigpipe_panic_toolkit — anchor x | head).
  - MSRV 1.85, no let-chains (recall baseline-gate discipline).
Open (next /dream pass / user — HELD, not yet drafted): anchor-watch (wm.anchor.* bus event on
  lost-root → homestead self-heal loop, mirrors keel-beacon/quicken-watch held notes). Should probe
  feed the docket ledger (open a watchman-root-lost key) vs just exit non-zero? — leaning: probe stays
  pure, the HOOK opens the docket key. Mid-session socket-teardown coverage (a wchg-shim that
  auto-reconciles-on-empty) — held until boot+session coverage proves insufficient. Alternative the
  user may prefer: configure watchman to persist watches instead of a reconciler (current --inetd unit
  doesn't restore; reconciler is the backend-agnostic answer but noting the option).

## 2026-06-05T  /dream  vision-coda  (seed: bare /dream → strongest UNADDRESSED open docket item; quicken took inert-kernel, keel took dead-cloud, anchor took watchman-roots, this session-summary loop was still open)
Drafted: PRD-coda-sweep.md, PRD-coda-audit.md, PRD-coda-close.md, PRD-coda-boot.md
Vision: visions/coda.md
Axis: keel=which brain TIER. anchor=which OBSERVATION roots. coda=did every
  session get its CLOSING summary. Same "is the footing real + legible" family,
  different substrate (the ctrace→scribe summary pipeline).
Motivation (live, measured): `~/.cache/ctrace/sessions/` = 1874 *.ndjson vs 1251
  *.summary.md → 623 ORPHANED (33%) as of 2026-06-05. Every timer tick today
  (claude-20260605T210001…T230000) is missing its summary. Cause is documented in
  ctrace-scribe/README: "Heavy headless sessions are SIGKILLed by cgroup teardown
  before the [SessionEnd] hook runs." Open docket item `ctrace-sessionend-flake`
  (first_seen 2026-05-30, still open) is exactly this. The repair engine EXISTS
  (`scribe backfill`) but only runs when self-review remembers — inconsistently
  (50 rendered 06-03, 2 on 06-02, 0 on 06-01). coda is the missing TRIGGER +
  DETECTION + SELF-HEALING layer; it does NOT re-implement rendering.
Order (STRICT hard dependency, mirrors anchor):
  coda-sweep FIRST (new repo ~/wintermute/coda, rust-cli; creates workspace +
    `coda` binary + SessionLog/SummaryState/DebtClass/SweepAction/SweepPlan types
    + LogStore trait + FakeStore + CodaConfig loader + PURE sweep diff). Do NOT
    start any rust-extend until sweep has SHIPPED and the repo exists, or
    extend-validate fails (the rule that bit relay+concord+quicken+keel+anchor).
  THEN: coda-audit ∥ coda-close (both depend on sweep ONLY, build in PARALLEL) →
    coda-boot (mixed: systemd timer + SessionStart hook; needs close's --apply).
Notes for /build:
  - coda-sweep + coda-audit are PURE-READ / cloud-build-safe: filesystem behind
    LogStore, FakeStore fixtures, clock + active-log INJECTED into the pure sweep.
    A test asserts sweep makes ZERO store calls; coda-audit asserts it calls ONLY
    read methods (logs / active-log resolve), never render.
  - coda-close defaults PRINT-ONLY; --apply is the ONE live-side-effect path
    (shells `scribe render` per orphan). Its ONE live AC (close the real backlog)
    is deferred_acs:[8] — cloud box has no scribe + no session history. Per-log
    render failure is counted, NOT fatal (one corrupt ndjson must not block 600).
  - coda-boot is mixed (systemd timer + SessionStart hook + installer). Live ACs
    deferred_acs:[5,6] (real session / real timer on the laptop). install PRINTS
    the settings.json hook entry + enable lines, does NOT auto-edit ~/.claude or
    auto-enable the timer (feedback_classifier_per_command). systemd-analyze verify
    is the offline gate. Hook backgrounds `coda close --apply --limit 50` and
    ALWAYS exits 0 (never block session start). KEY INSIGHT: the fix lives in the
    NEXT session's SessionStart, NOT in the dying session's SessionEnd.
  - audit/close/boot each require their integration test ENTRY FILE (tests/audit.rs,
    tests/close.rs, tests/boot.rs) to appear in cargo output (self_orphaned_mock_tests).
  - coda is INWARD toolkit (sibling of vigil/quicken/keel/anchor/binstale) →
    publishes as a j0yen repo like the rest of the self-tooling, NOT outward/civic.
  - sigpipe::reset() first line of main() in the binary (self_sigpipe_panic_toolkit
    — `coda audit --orphaned-only | head`).
  - MSRV 1.85, no let-chains (recall baseline-gate discipline).
  - COORDINATION: once coda-boot is live, self-review's per-run `scribe backfill`
    step becomes redundant — coda becomes canonical. Don't ship a self-review edit
    that races coda; gossip before touching the self-review skill's backfill phase.
Open (next /dream pass / user — HELD, not yet drafted): coda-witness (rust-extend;
  emit wm.coda.debt to docket, edge-triggered like keel-beacon — but the boot HOOK
  may be the right place to open the docket key vs a separate probe; decide after
  boot ships). Retention/prune of summarized ndjson >N days (DESTRUCTIVE, separate
  concern, user opts in). Should coda-close SUBSUME self-review's backfill entirely
  vs run alongside (leaning: canonical, coordinate via gossip). Grace-window tuning
  (started 120s).

## 2026-06-05T  /dream  vision-christen  (seed: bare /dream → strongest UNADDRESSED open docket item)
Drafted: PRD-christen-plan.md, PRD-christen-detect.md, PRD-christen-route.md,
  PRD-christen-cap.md, PRD-christen-ledger.md
Vision: visions/christen.md
Axis: keel=which brain TIER. anchor=which OBSERVATION roots. coda=did every
  session get its CLOSING summary. christen=does every session get its TRUE
  NAME (agent-namespace identity) at birth. Same "is the footing real +
  legible" family; substrate = the CLONE_NEWAGENT per-session identity layer.
Motivation (live, measured 2026-06-05): the agentns substrate is BUILT + BOOTED
  but INERT. `/proc/self/ns/agent -> agent:[4026531996]` = the INIT namespace;
  all 3 live Claude PIDs read `agent_session = 0…0`, all `agent_counters` zero,
  despite `CONFIG_AGENT_NS=y` on 7.0.10-arch1-5-wintermute. Root cause is
  STRUCTURAL: a SessionStart HOOK cannot unshare its already-running parent —
  the wrap must happen at EXEC time (`agentns-claude --intent … -- claude`),
  which means editing the launch sites + granting the launcher CAP_SYS_ADMIN.
  Neither was ever done. The launchers (agentns-claude, agent-wrap) + probe
  (agentns-doctor) ALL exist and are installed; christen is the missing WIRING
  layer, not new primitives. Closes the single unaddressed open docket item
  `agentns-session-zeros` (warn, 8 reports across 6 runs since 2026-05-30, no
  playbook) — keel took `wm-anthropic-key-empty`, coda took `ctrace-sessionend-flake`.
Order (STRICT hard dependency, mirrors anchor/coda):
  christen-plan FIRST (new repo ~/wintermute/christen, rust-cli; creates
    workspace + `christen` binary + LaunchSite/SiteKind/WrapState/RouteAction/
    RoutePlan types + LaunchSiteSource trait + FakeSource + ChristenConfig +
    PURE planner). Do NOT start any rust-extend until plan has SHIPPED and the
    repo exists, or extend-validate fails (the rule that bit relay/concord/
    quicken/keel/anchor).
  THEN: christen-detect ∥ christen-route ∥ christen-cap (all depend on plan
    ONLY, build in PARALLEL) → christen-ledger (meaningful once route is live;
    builds vs FakeStore).
Notes for /build:
  - christen-plan is PURE / cloud-build-safe: launch sites behind LaunchSiteSource,
    FakeSource fixtures, KernelInfo + wrapper_installed INJECTED into the pure
    `plan`. A test asserts `plan` makes ZERO source calls.
  - christen-detect is read-only except a single `docket report`/`resolve`
    edge-trigger. Anti-regression invariant (from the existing draft proposal
    self-review-agentns-block.draft.md): the string "registration failed" MUST
    NOT appear for any state — a test iterates every NsState and asserts it.
    Live `/proc/self` AC is deferred_acs:[7] (needs -wintermute kernel).
  - christen-route is mixed (systemd drop-in installer). DEFAULT print-only;
    --apply writes `10-christen.conf` drop-ins but NEVER daemon-reload/enable/
    restart (prints those — feedback_classifier_per_command). Offline gate is
    `systemd-analyze --user verify` on the generated drop-in (skip-with-note if
    absent, never silent-pass — self_orphaned_mock_tests). The clear-then-set
    `ExecStart=` / `ExecStart=…` pair is a systemd correctness detail a test
    must assert. Live wiring of the 3 real units is deferred_acs:[7].
  - christen-cap is mixed + SECURITY-SENSITIVE. NEVER auto-`setcap`; prints the
    scope explainer THEN the `sudo setcap cap_sys_admin+ep <path>` line. cap_plan
    is pure. `--verify` spawns the launcher under `sbx` and reads the child's
    agent_session for a nonzero id (deferred_acs:[6], needs -wintermute + sbx).
    README documents the narrower setuid-helper alternative as an open decision.
  - christen-ledger is mixed + wires `agentns-doctor receipt` (does NOT
    re-implement counter reading). Open-only entries are a SIGKILL SIGNAL, not a
    bug (coda lesson: headless ticks die before graceful hooks). Live ledger AC
    deferred_acs:[7]. Hook installer PRINTS settings.json entries, no auto-edit.
  - christen is INWARD toolkit (sibling of vigil/quicken/keel/anchor/coda) →
    publishes as a j0yen repo, NOT outward/civic.
  - sigpipe::reset() first line of main() in the binary (self_sigpipe_panic_toolkit).
  - MSRV 1.85, no let-chains (recall baseline-gate discipline).
  - CAP ORDERING: christen-route's wiring is INERT until christen-cap's setcap
    is granted (unshare EPERMs and falls back to unwrapped exec). Build order is
    parallel, but the LIVE effect needs cap BEFORE route's drop-ins do anything.
Open (next /dream pass / user — HELD, not yet drafted): christen-budget
  (rust-extend; measured per-intent budget ceilings from real counter histograms
  + a runaway-kill verification — draft once route is live and we have histograms).
  Narrower-privilege setuid helper (security, user decision). Interactive-shell
  routing is user-typed → christen can only Advise (print alias); systemd sites
  are the deterministic win.

## Pending (build reflect candidate) — 2026-06-06T06:39:07Z
**Integrate-collision pattern**: this tick, 4/8 parallel same-target branches built green in their worktrees but DEFERRED at `worktree-extend.sh integrate` because siblings touched the same files:
- concord-bridge + concord-cruxes → both exit 3 (Cargo.lock dirty from the other); NEITHER integrated.
- quicken-attest → exit 4 (conflict in main.rs/Cargo.toml vs quicken-remedy, which won and shipped v0.3.0).
- anchor-probe → exit 4 (conflict in lib.rs/main.rs vs anchor-reconcile, which won and shipped v0.2.0).
The skill's "sequential branches increment cleanly" assumes non-overlapping diffs; when two same-target branches edit the same lines (esp. Cargo.lock, main.rs subcommand enum, lib.rs pub API), the second always conflicts and defers. Candidate guardrail: integrate should auto-rebase the loser onto the just-merged HEAD and retry (or branches should land Cargo.lock changes via a regen step, not commit it). Deferred branches keep their branch; next tick resumes serially via `add`. (Reflect budget spent today — pick this up next reflect.)

## 2026-06-06T00:00  /dream  vision-loom
Drafted: PRD-loom-rebase-retry.md, PRD-loom-lockfile-regen.md,
  PRD-loom-libapi-append.md, PRD-loom-serial-fallback.md
Vision: visions/loom.md
Seed: the "Integrate-collision pattern" build-reflect candidate (gossip
  2026-06-06T06:39:07Z) + journal 2026-06-05 (quicken-attest, anchor-probe
  deferrals) + read of worktree-extend.sh:81-84 (integrate aborts+exit-4 on any
  conflict; no rebase, no lockfile handling, no retry).
Relationship to existing work: the in-tree PRD
  build-shared-cli-dispatch-merge-safe (status needs_classification) is the
  CLI-dispatch *leaf* of this vision — loom does NOT redraft it. loom covers the
  OTHER collision surfaces (Cargo.lock, lib.rs pub surface) + the self-healing
  retry loop + a serial-fallback backstop, and CONSUMES that PRD's
  `last_error=integrate-conflict:<files>` sidecar telemetry.
Order for /build:
  - build-shared-cli-dispatch-merge-safe ships independently (CLI leaf).
  - loom-rebase-retry, loom-lockfile-regen, loom-libapi-append ALL edit
    worktree-extend.sh / build-skill — they are themselves a same-target trio.
    *** SERIALIZE THEM — do NOT fan these three in parallel, or they will hit
    the very integrate-collision they're meant to fix (eat our own dog food).
    *** Recommended order: rebase-retry FIRST (it's the safety net that makes
    the next two's own integration self-heal), then lockfile-regen, then
    libapi-append.
  - loom-serial-fallback LAST: it consumes the conflict telemetry that
    build-shared-cli-dispatch-merge-safe (and loom-rebase-retry AC4) write —
    do not build it before at least one producer ships, or it reads an absent
    key. Treat absent telemetry as "no streak / parallel as today" (fail-open),
    NOT as a reason to serialize (self_build_jq_escape_reads_absent).
Notes:
  - All four are build_target:self-mod into the build skill (no new repo, no
    publish). Match the existing build-shared-cli-dispatch-merge-safe frontmatter.
  - loom-libapi-append deliberately extends the cli-register.sh anchored-append
    pattern to lib.rs; it depends on that pattern existing but its helper
    (lib-register.sh) is independent code, so it can build before or after the
    CLI PRD.
Open questions: `loom doctor` read-only stall report (held — draft once
  serial-fallback writes the streak ledger it would read). Rebase-retry cap at 1
  vs small-N backoff (start at 1). Cargo.lock driver: merge=ours+regen (chosen)
  vs union (risks invalid TOML).

- 2026-06-06T07:32:30Z (build): coda cluster — coda-audit established local `main` + integrated v0.2.0, but `j0yen/coda` remote is missing; needs `wm-publish --slug coda` (add to ALLOW) or manual `gh repo create`. keel cluster blocked: no `main` branch until keel-pulse ships.

## 2026-06-06T07:38  /dream  vision-quicken (extend, Fleet 2)
Drafted: PRD-quicken-watch.md, PRD-quicken-notify.md
Vision: visions/quicken.md (updated — Fleet 2 = the boot/bus-reactive half)
Seed: bare /dream + Phase-1 live re-probe (memlog group EACCES w/ pkgrel
  gap now 5->11, agentns /proc/self/agent_session all-zeros, bpolicy
  {"loaded":false}, provfs degraded-because-agentns) + the realization
  that Fleet 1's probe is DAILY-only while primitives die mid-day
  (self_agorabus_restart_kills_voice is the canonical edge a daily probe
  can't see).
Why an extend, not a new vision: spent this pass confirming the obvious
  threads are already owned — docket (track findings), warden (bpolicy
  arming), continuity/onramp (agentns wrap + memlog group/udev), vigil
  (stale running bytes), and quicken itself (built-but-never-alive). The
  kernel/self-review/introspection cluster is saturated. quicken is the
  precise match to the strongest LIVE evidence, so this extends it rather
  than wedging in a duplicate #41.
Order for /build:
  - quicken-watch FIRST (publishes wm.health.primitive.<name> verdicts to
    agorabus). Hard dep on Fleet 1's quicken-probe having shipped (repo
    ~/wintermute/quicken exists: quicken + quicken-probe crates — confirmed).
  - quicken-notify SECOND (subscribes, fires on transitions only). Depends
    on watch publishing the topic, BUT can build against fixture event
    streams in parallel; only the live AC5 (real bus round-trip) needs
    watch shipped. Treat watch-absent as "no events" (fail-open), per
    self_build_jq_escape_reads_absent.
  - Both are rust-extend into ~/wintermute/quicken — SERIALIZE THEM (same
    build_into; loom/integrate-collision lesson: same-target parallel
    branches conflict on Cargo.lock/main.rs subcommand enum). watch then
    notify.
Reuse / non-duplication notes:
  - Reuses the EXISTING wm.health.* envelope (produced by
    wintermute-brain/degrade.rs, consumed by docket/digest.rs). Supersedes
    quicken's old open-question idea of a parallel wm.quicken.* topic — so
    docket-digest picks up quicken verdicts for free.
  - Disjoint from wintermute_watchdog (it watches DAEMON heartbeat; quicken
    watches kernel/userspace PRIMITIVE liveness; same envelope, different
    subject namespace primitive.<name>). Flagged for jsy: one envelope /
    two producers, confirm not a merge.
  - Strictly REPORT, never heal — homestead still owns any future
    unattended self-heal. The report-vs-heal line stays firm.
Still held (not drafted): agentns root-cause = an INSTRUMENTATION PRD in
  the agentns repo proving WHERE the zero comes from before any fix
  (feedback_verify_before_concluding), not a quicken PRD. Self-heal-vs-report
  still report-only.
Open questions for jsy: confirm wm.health.* shared envelope / two-producer
  shape; default OnUnitActiveSec for the watch timer (drafted 30min);
  whether --ping (peon-ping on transition) should default on or off (drafted off).

## 2026-06-06T08:08  /dream  vision-assay (new)
Drafted: PRD-assay-agentns.md, PRD-agentns-clone-flag-fix.md, PRD-assay-quicken-bridge.md
Vision: visions/assay.md
Seed: bare /dream + Phase-1 LIVE run (not a surface read). The strongest
  unaddressed signal this pass was a WRONG CONCLUSION baked into two existing
  visions, caught only by exercising the primitive.
THE FINDING (verify-first, feedback_verify_before_concluding): on the booted
  7.0.10-arch1-5-wintermute kernel, `~/wintermute/agentns/tests/test_unshare`
  prints `unshare(CLONE_NEWAGENT) failed: Invalid argument` (EINVAL). The
  compiled flag is `#define CLONE_NEWAGENT 0x00000100` == **CLONE_VM** — a bit
  collision; patch-0001's commit msg claims 0x40000000 (== CLONE_NEWNET, also
  taken). The legacy 32-bit clone-flag space is EXHAUSTED. So the agentns
  all-zeros is NOT a wiring gap — the namespace physically cannot be created
  via legacy unshare.
  ⇒ onramp's SHIPPED `claude-agentns-wrap` is FUTILE (it calls the rejected
    flag). I added a ⚠ blocked-by note to visions/onramp.md (durable update,
    not a rewrite).
  ⇒ quicken's AgentnsProbe verdict `Inert` is correct-but-uninformative — it
    reads the live process (always init ns → always zero) and can never tell
    wiring-gap from kernel-bug.
Order for /build:
  - PRD-assay-agentns FIRST. Airtight (the diagnosis is already proven by the
    live run); new workspace ~/wintermute/assay (rust-cli); no consumers; ships
    independently. AC2 REQUIRES it reproduce the EINVAL + 0x100==CLONE_VM
    verdict on the booted kernel.
  - PRD-agentns-clone-flag-fix and PRD-assay-quicken-bridge BOTH depend on
    assay-agentns but are independent of EACH OTHER → may build in parallel
    (disjoint build_into: ~/wintermute/agentns kernel-patches vs
    ~/wintermute/quicken rust-extend; no integrate-collision).
Heads-up for /build:
  - agentns-clone-flag-fix is build_target:mixed (kernel patch + apply-agentns.py
    anchor). Its LIVE proof ACs (3,4) are USER-GATED on a reboot of the rebuilt
    kernel (same reboot window self-review keeps flagging for the blocked
    linux/linux-firmware pacman queue). Build/apply ACs (1,2,5,6,7) are NOT
    gated — advance those autonomously; park the proof ACs as deferred_acs.
  - assay-quicken-bridge is rust-extend into quicken; keep the Verdict enum +
    PrimitiveReport JSON append-only (docket-digest consumes it). Fail-open if
    `assay` is absent (self_build_jq_escape_reads_absent).
  - DO NOT re-ship onramp's claude-agentns-wrap as-is — re-point it at the new
    `agentns-unshare` (prctl) shim from agentns-clone-flag-fix first.
Open questions for jsy (vision §Open questions): the real design decision is
  the creation MECHANISM for the fix — prctl(PR_SET_AGENT_NS) (drafted default,
  reuses patch-0005 dispatch, no clone bit) vs clone3-only (unshare can't reach
  it) vs reclaim a legacy bit (risky). Settle BEFORE agentns-clone-flag-fix is
  built. Also: should `assay` ever absorb quicken's passive probes (drafted no —
  stay disjoint: assay exercises mechanisms, quicken reads live state).

## 2026-06-06T01:40  /dream  vision-warrant (new)
Drafted: PRD-warrant-corpus.md, PRD-warrant-audit.md, PRD-warrant-docket.md
Vision: visions/warrant.md
Seed: bare /dream + Phase-1 LIVE verification (not a surface read). Second
  consecutive pass to catch a SHIPPED/CLOSED PRD whose closing mechanism
  claim is mechanically false (yesterday: assay→onramp's agentns-wrap futile).

THE FINDING (verify-first, feedback_verify_before_concluding) — a FALSE CLOSE,
  proven live:
  `PRD-ctrace-session-end-resilient.md` is `Status: Closed (2026-06-02) —
  outcome achieved live by a different mechanism`. The named mechanism:
  "ctrace-reap.timer runs ctrace-orphan-reap --apply every 2 min; its
  render_log step summarizes any orphaned *.ndjson." THIS IS FALSE.
  - `ctrace-orphan-reap --apply` renders a log ONLY on `verdict:
    orphaned-tracer` (a *live* stranded tracer to stop+render).
  - But the SAME repo's `ctrace-reap.service` comment says: "session.bt now
    self-terminates on root exit, so this should normally find nothing." Live
    journalctl confirms: `verdict: healthy` → `apply: state is healthy;
    nothing to do`.
  - ⇒ The two shipped fixes are MUTUALLY DEFEATING: self-terminating the
    tracer removes the orphan the reaper needed to trigger render. In the
    common SIGKILL case (every headless /build /dream /self-review tick) there
    is NO orphan → reaper renders NOTHING → and SessionEnd hook never fired
    (SIGKILL) → the log is summarized by NOTHING but self-review's hand-run
    `scribe backfill`. (`ctrace-session-end.sh` also still shells the slow
    `summarize-ctrace-session.sh`, never `scribe`.)
  ⇒ The gap silently REOPENED to 623/1874 (33%) by 2026-06-05 — which is the
    ONLY reason the `coda` vision + 4 PRDs had to be drafted from scratch.
    coda IS the correct superseding fix; warrant does NOT re-fix it.

DURABLE CORRECTION for /build (do NOT trust the 06-02 close):
  - PRD-ctrace-session-end-resilient.md's close is mechanically false for the
    common case. Treat `coda` (coda-sweep→audit∥close→boot, in-flight) as the
    real fix for the ctrace summary-debt gap. Do not ship anything that leans
    on "ctrace-reap.timer backfills summaries" — it does not.

vision-warrant = the CLOSE-side dual of assay (assay attests a PRIMITIVE's
  creation mechanism by forking a child; warrant attests a CLOSE's claimed
  mechanism by running a declared side-effect-free assertion — incl. the
  systemd/shell/timer/pipeline closes assay structurally can't fork). Inward
  toolkit, sibling of docket/coda/quicken/assay; publishes as a j0yen repo.

Order (STRICT hard chain, mirrors coda/anchor):
  - warrant-corpus FIRST. New repo ~/wintermute/warrant (rust-cli). Ships the
    workspace + types (CloseClaim/ClaimKind/Warrant/AssertionSpec/
    WarrantStatus/WarrantVerdict/AuditPlan) + CloseSource trait + FakeSource +
    a PURE `classify()` (AC2: zero source calls, no IO). No consumers; ships
    independently; cloud-build-safe.
  - THEN warrant-audit (rust-extend): real FsDocketSource over PRDs-archive/ +
    a warrants.toml registry of side-effect-free assertions + the runner.
    First warrant shipped = the session-end-resilient one → resolves Refuted.
    DO NOT start until warrant-corpus has SHIPPED + repo exists
    (extend-validate rule that bit relay/concord/quicken/keel/anchor).
  - THEN warrant-docket (rust-extend): edge-triggered reopen of Refuted closes
    into docket under slug `warrant:<source>`; print-only default, --apply
    gated; fail-open if docket absent. Depends on audit's verdict JSON.

Heads-up for /build:
  - All three are PURE-READ / cloud-build-safe in their non-[live] ACs (source
    behind a trait, FakeSource/FakeDocketSink fixtures, archive dir INJECTED).
    The [live] ACs (warrant-audit AC8, warrant-docket AC8) need ~/.claude/
    scripts + ctrace on the real laptop → park as deferred_acs, advance the
    rest autonomously.
  - warrant-audit enforces a side-effect-free assertion contract (AC3: rejects
    a CommandExit cmd containing --apply/rm/>/write at load). Keep that gate.
  - sigpipe::reset() first line of main() (self_sigpipe_panic_toolkit).
  - MSRV 1.85, no let-chains; tests/{corpus,audit,report}.rs must each appear
    as `Running tests/<x>.rs` in cargo output (self_orphaned_mock_tests).
  - DocketSink + FsDocketSource both fail-open on missing docket
    (self_build_jq_escape_reads_absent).

Open questions for jsy (vision §Open questions — HELD, not drafted):
  - warrant-GATE (prevention): a /build close-time hook that refuses to write
    a "by a different mechanism" close note unless a warrant is registered.
    This is the load-bearing half (stop false closes BEFORE vs detect AFTER)
    but touches the /build close path + classifier — not yet traced. Draft
    after warrant-audit + locating the close-note write site.
  - assay-bridge: when a close's mechanism IS a kernel primitive, delegate the
    warrant to `assay <name>` instead of a local assertion (unify creation-
    side + close-side under one verdict). Draft once both are live.
  - Should `warrants.toml` be hand-written at close time, or should audit
    propose a stub per Unwarranted close? v1 = hand-written + Unwarranted
    backlog; auto-stub is Fleet 2.

## 2026-06-06T08:10  /dream  vision-constellation (extend — operational hardening)
Drafted: PRD-constellation-secrets.md, PRD-constellation-headscale.md, PRD-constellation-voice-role.md
Vision: visions/constellation.md (added "Operational hardening" section)
Seed: bare /dream. Inward self-tooling space is SATURATED (anchor owns
  watchman-rewatch, coda+scribe own ctrace summary-debt, assay owns the agentns
  flag-collision) — verified by direct grep, did not re-draft any of them.
  constellation is the live frontier: base components shipped/in-flight
  (wm-busbridge v0.1.1 built; constellation/{ansible,chezmoi,localrepo} +
  constellation-provision worktree active in wchg), so I extended with the three
  un-drafted pieces that block a real 2nd node — each answers a vision Open question.

Order: secrets → headscale ‖ voice-role.
  - constellation-secrets is the HARD prerequisite for any multi-host work: mesh
    AC1 ("auth key from the encrypted store"), the bus's NATS creds, and the cloud
    brain's WM_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY all consume a store that does not exist yet.
    appearance's chezmoi-age covers ONLY dotfile tokens AFTER the host key exists —
    it does not bootstrap the root key or manage service secrets. Build secrets
    before headscale.
  - constellation-headscale is the SERVER half of mesh's AC9 (mesh ships only the
    client flag pointing at an absent server). Depends on secrets (server key +
    issued pre-auth keys are managed secrets) AND constellation-cloud (the host).
    Do NOT start until secrets has shipped — extend-validate rule.
  - constellation-voice-role is INDEPENDENT (refines provision; can build in
    parallel). Makes boot-to-voice a per-host flag so cloud/compute nodes don't
    bring up a mic stack. Additive + backward-compatible (no flag = role default).

Notes for /build:
  - All three are build_target: shell, siblings of the constellation family
    (mesh/provision/appearance pattern). sigpipe::reset() guard on any helper
    (self_sigpipe_panic_toolkit). Keep the "repo contains no plaintext secret"
    grep-gate that appearance AC6 established — secrets AC3/AC10 + headscale AC2
    all lean on it.
  - secrets AC4 needs two distinct test age keys / a FakeRecipient to prove
    role-scoped decryption without real cloud keys — fixture-able, cloud-build-safe.
  - The [live] multi-host ACs (mesh-reachability, real Headscale registration) need
    a second machine; park those as deferred_acs and advance the
    fixture/FakeRecipient/local-server ACs autonomously (deferred_acs inline-int
    form only — self_deferred_acs_inline_only).

Open questions (HELD, not drafted — need user/state):
  - Bootstrap delivery channel default: manual-paste/USB vs cloud-tunnel. PRD
    documents both; user picks the canonical one when node 2 actually arrives.
  - secrets backend: sops+age (drafted) is the assumption. If the user prefers
    Vault/agenix the PRD's store half changes; bootstrap half is unaffected.

## 2026-06-06T09:33  /dream  vision-kin (Fleet 2 — closing the open loops)
Drafted: PRD-reach-inbound-imap.md, PRD-reach-silence-nudge.md, PRD-reach-distress-durability.md
Vision: visions/kin.md (added "Fleet 2 — closing the open loops" section)
Seed: bare /dream. Inward self-tooling SATURATED (verified — last dream's note
  holds); constellation just extended this morning (08:10) so NOT re-touched.
  Picked kin: an OUTWARD vision whose Fleet-1 daemons all SHIPPED (wintermute-reach
  v0.2.0, presence, family-enroll, dialog Family/Distress branches) but whose
  feedback paths are stubbed/missing. 3 of 7 end-states are half-open — drafted the
  three loop-closers, each cited to a grep of the shipped repo.

Order (all rust-extend → wintermute-reach, disjoint modules, parallel-safe):
  - reach-inbound-imap  — REAL inbound reply channel (async-imap 0.9 / maildir poll)
      → publishes wm.family.reply, replacing the `wm-reach reply` v1 CLI stub
      (main.rs:7, dispatch.rs:54). dialog on_reply→TTS (family.rs:363) already waits
      for it. Closes end-state #2 "you can reach her back." Security AC: From-allowlist
      = enrolled caregiver address only (spoken-to-Mom = injection surface).
  - reach-silence-nudge — standalone gentle "haven't heard from Mom" delivery on
      wm.presence.silence. Today silence is ONLY a digest-body flag (digest.rs:12
      "does NOT trigger"), and the digest defaults OFF → a silent day can vanish.
      Closes end-state #4. Opt-in, debounced per-window, never an alarm.
  - reach-distress-durability — retry+backoff then fallback-transport escalation
      (ntfy/webhook are already Cargo features, Cargo.toml:20-21) BEFORE a distress
      acks delivered:false. Today daemon.rs delivers distress once; a nack ends the
      safety loop unobserved. Hardens end-state #5. Distress-only; messages unchanged.

OQ#3 ("distress confirm vs immediacy") was ALREADY RESOLVED in dialog/src/distress.rs
  (Severity::Hard/Soft + classify() + soft-confirm prompt) — did NOT draft it.

Notes for /build:
  - reach is at v0.2.0; these bump v0.3.0→v0.4.0→v0.5.0 if built sequentially, but
    they touch disjoint modules (inbound / digest+config / daemon delivery) so a
    parallel build just rebases each onto the prior minor.
  - All default-OFF / opt-in except the distress ladder (distress already defaults
    ON and is pre-filtered by dialog). Keep "no secret/body logged" — every AC has a
    no-body-logged clause; reach already reads creds from /etc/wintermute/conf.d/.
  - Live legs are fixture-able: maildir + FakeTransport/FakeRecipient cover the
    autonomous proof; the real-IMAP-server smoke is the only deferred_acs (inline-int
    form only — self_deferred_acs_inline_only).
  - async-imap 0.9 rustls-only precedent is wintermute-mail/Cargo.toml:72 (no native
    OpenSSL); sigpipe::reset() already in reach.

Open questions (HELD — need jsy, already in vision OQ#1/#2):
  - Which physical fallback transport on jsy's phone (ntfy self-hosted / gotify /
    SMS gateway)? distress-durability proves the LADDER with fakes; the deployment
    choice is jsy's.
  - Webhook/push inbound (device-reachable-from-outside) deferred — inbound-imap is
    the headless-safe minimum. A durable on-disk distress outbox (crash-replay) is a
    noted Fleet-3 follow-on, not drafted.

## 2026-06-06T03:05  /dream  (saturation scan — no PRDs drafted)
Seed: bare /dream (interactive). Verified, did not assume.
Finding: every strong inward signal from tonight's research already has an
  ACTIVE vision, several built TODAY — re-checked to ground, not surface:
  - ctrace SessionEnd summaries (625 missing in self-review prose) → coda
    (coda-boot/close/sweep, v0.2 local today). LIVE: ~/.cache/ctrace/sessions
    = 5 missing, not 625; coda backfill is working.
  - watchman drops roots on reboot / wchg lies silently → anchor
    (anchor-roots/boot/probe, v0.3 today). I independently re-derived this
    seam (sketched 'moor') from recall 01KT6VCBX1PSWT9MAQP607TAWY + verified
    no boot wiring exists + watchman roots present only via manual re-watch —
    then found anchor already drafted+shipped it citing the SAME recall hit.
  - agentns all-zeros → assay. warden inert → warden. stale binary → vigil.
    dead cloud tier → keel. re-noticed findings w/o forcing fn → docket.
Tonight's journal/recall surfaced ONLY inward self-review material; no fresh
  OUTWARD evidence. Prior two ticks today already went outward (kin Fleet-2
  09:33, constellation 08:10). Per hard-rule 6 (don't dream past research) +
  rule 3 (cite research), drafted nothing rather than fabricate.
Asked jsy for direction (interactive); question dismissed → recorded this
  and stopped.
Notes for /build: nothing new from this tick. The covering visions above are
  the live queue; advance those.
Open question for next /dream: the only un-visioned recurring escalations are
  install/arming ACTIONS, not design gaps (memlog staged-awaiting-install,
  warden arming, binstale never installed). These want a user action or a
  forcing-function PRD under docket — not a new vision. Reconsider if they
  keep aging.

## 2026-06-06T07:45  /dream  (saturation scan #2 — no PRDs drafted)
Seed: bare /dream (interactive). Verified to ground, did not assume.
Second consecutive bare /dream hitting INWARD saturation. Re-checked the two
  recurring self-review signals against their covering visions — both real,
  both already drafted/active:
  - SessionEnd hook NOT firing on SIGKILL'd headless ticks → 623/1874 logs
    orphaned → coda (sweep/audit/close/boot drafted; coda-boot's SessionStart
    trigger IS the root-cause fix, not a band-aid). v0.2 today.
  - Recurring findings + activation/arming ACTIONS (memlog staged-awaiting-
    install, warden inert, binstale never installed) → docket (ledger w/
    first-seen/streak/escalate/auto-close). Confirmed these are user/forcing-
    function ACTIONS, not design gaps — same conclusion as the 03:05 tick.
Tonight's journal/recall surfaced ONLY inward self-review material; no fresh
  OUTWARD evidence. Drafted nothing rather than fabricate a 41st inward vision.
Asked jsy for direction (interactive AskUserQuestion); dismissed. Recorded +
  stopped, per hard-rule 6 + the 03:05 precedent.
Notes for /build: nothing new this tick. coda + docket + the live outward
  visions (homeward/kin/constellation) are the queue; advance those.
NEW open question for next /dream (worth not losing): this session connected
  external MCP servers (claude.ai Gmail / Google Calendar / Google Drive /
  AtScale) — a surface NONE of the 40 visions touch. A genuinely un-covered
  outward seam: a calendar-and-email-aware assistant layer. Caveat: connectors
  are interactive-only ("may be absent in headless/cron runs" — memory note),
  so a /build-auto vision can't depend on them; it'd be an interactive-facing
  vision. Flagged for jsy to confirm direction before drafting.

## 2026-06-08T05:25  /dream  (saturation scan #3 — no PRDs drafted)
Seed: bare /dream (interactive, manual). Verified to ground, did not assume.
Third consecutive bare /dream hitting INWARD saturation. Grounded again:
  tonight's journal (2026-06-07 self-review) and recall reflective seeds are
  ALL inward maintenance — pacman-101-blocked, ctrace-sessionend-flake,
  agentns-session-zeros, memlog-activation, warden-inert. Every one already
  has a covering vision (coda/assay/docket/warden) or is a user-gated ACTION,
  not a design gap. No fresh OUTWARD evidence in journal or recall.
DIFFERENCE this tick: the MCP connectors the 06-06 ticks flagged as the one
  un-covered outward seam (Gmail / Google Calendar / Google Drive / AtScale)
  ARE live + callable in this interactive session — the "interactive-only,
  absent headless" caveat is satisfied right now. Surfaced it to jsy via
  AskUserQuestion (4 options: MCP-assistant-layer vision / extend an outward
  vision / inward forcing-functions / nothing). Question DISMISSED.
Per hard-rule 6 + the 03:05 & 07:45 precedent: dismissed → recorded + stopped.
  Drafted nothing rather than fabricate a 41st vision.
Notes for /build: nothing new this tick. Live queue unchanged — advance the
  active visions (homeward/kin/constellation outward; coda/docket inward).
STANDING open question (now raised 3×, still un-answered): an MCP-connector-
  aware assistant layer is the only outward direction none of the 40 visions
  touch. It needs jsy's explicit go-ahead because its PRDs are inherently
  interactive-facing (can't depend on connectors in /build-auto headless
  ticks). Until then it stays un-drafted by design, not by omission.

## 2026-06-08T05:39  /dream  vision-ousia  (6 PRDs — first OUTWARD ontology vision)
Seed (jsy, interactive): "of making ethical AI possible with these ideas.
  implement OWL2 and SPARQL tools to make ethical grounded BFO a market success."
THE un-covered outward seam the last 3 ticks kept flagging — finally seeded by
  jsy directly. None of the prior 40 visions touch ontology/BFO/OWL/SPARQL/ethics.
Grounded hard in real artifacts:
  - ~/Notes/AtScale/World-Ontology-paper.md (v1.0.0, 509-class OWL2 DL / BFO 2020
    paper, sentience→dignity→rights as reasoner-enforced axioms). REAL + complete.
  - KEY GAP: world-ontology.owl does NOT exist on disk — only the paper. So
    PRD-ousia-forge (build the .owl from a declarative spec) is the gate.
  - ~/Notes/AtScale/book-outline-ontological-semantic-layer.md = the market thesis
    (formal ontology for the semantic-layer category) → PRD-ousia-atscale bridge.
  - AtScale MCP live this session (list_models/describe_model/run_query) → real
    connector for the atscale bridge's interactive path.
Drafted: PRD-ousia-forge, -reason, -sparql, -guard, -mcp, -atscale.
Vision: visions/ousia.md
Order: forge → reason → sparql → guard → mcp ; atscale branches off forge+sparql.
  forge is the hard gate — every other PRD needs an .owl to operate on.
Notes for /build:
  - BUILD forge FIRST. Nothing downstream is testable without it. It has no ousia
    deps (only horned-owl + serde/toml).
  - reason/sparql/guard form a lib chain (each exposes a lib crate the next
    consumes) — respect that order; don't parallel-ship guard before sparql lib.
  - Reasoner is a hand-rolled forward-chainer over the paper's 10 all-some axioms
    (OWL2 EL/RL), NOT a full DL reasoner. whelk-rs upgrade path, HermiT/JVM is the
    documented escape hatch but OUT of scope. Don't let an agent pull a JVM dep.
  - crates.io API is 403-rate-limiting this box (data-access policy) — could not
    confirm exact crate versions. horned-owl/oxigraph/sophia are real; pin versions
    at build time. If a Rust MCP SDK crate doesn't resolve for ousia-mcp, the PRD
    permits a hand-rolled JSON-RPC stdio loop.
  - ousia-atscale + ousia-mcp have interactive-only live paths (MCP connectors
    absent in headless ticks) — but BOTH PRDs gate that behind an offline JSON
    path that IS build-auto-testable. ACs require no live connector. Build them
    headless; the live path is layered convenience.
Open questions (in vision doc):
  - Federation Model source doc not on disk; extracting the 10 axioms from the
    paper §3.1/§5 directly (sufficient). Ask jsy if the source doc would enrich.
  - A dedicated ousia-conformance PRD (paper §8 is concretely testable) may split
    out of reason's ACs on a later pass.

## 2026-06-08T05:44  /dream  vision-ousia  (open-question resolved)
jsy pointer: the Federation Model source IS on disk —
  ~/Notes/federation-utopian-philosophy.md (canonical, 2026-05-19; stale dup at
  ~/Notes/AtScale/Reference/federation-utopian-philosophy.md). All 10 tenets
  present verbatim (§3.1 list). Vision open-question updated to RESOLVED.
Note for /build (ousia-forge): source the per-class philosophicalGrounding /
  aiGuidance annotation TEXT from this file rather than paraphrasing the paper.
  The 10 formal axioms still come from the paper §5. No PRD modified (hard-rule
  2) — guidance carried via the vision doc, which forge's open-questions defer to.

## 2026-06-08T05:55  /dream  vision-herald  (3 PRDs — distribution layer for ousia)
Seed (jsy, interactive): "of a what to package a distribute ethical reasoning as a skill."
Direct follow-on to vision-ousia (drafted 30 min earlier). ousia answers "what is
  ethical reasoning"; herald answers "how does anyone else GET it."
Grounded:
  - Skills here = SKILL.md dirs symlinked into ~/.claude/skills/ from ~/wintermute/
    (build -> build-skill etc). Fine for the author, UNINSTALLABLE by anyone else.
  - VERIFIED gap: no wintermute repo ships a .claude-plugin/plugin.json; no j0yen
    marketplace.json exists. Existing skill tooling (skill-doctor/skill-manifest/
    wm-skill-edit) only VALIDATES/EDITS installed skills — none PACKAGES for distro.
  - Target format known: official marketplace.json (222 plugins) = top-level
    name+owner + plugins[] with source {git-subdir,url,path,ref,sha}. herald emits
    into that exact shape — no protocol invention.
  - ousia-guard PRD confirmed on disk (the reasoning engine conscience wraps).
Drafted: PRD-herald-pack, PRD-herald-market, PRD-herald-conscience.
Vision: visions/herald.md
Order: herald-pack → (herald-market ∥ herald-conscience). pack is the gate;
  conscience ALSO depends on ousia-guard (cross-vision dep — don't ship conscience
  before the ousia fleet's guard/reason libs land).
Notes for /build:
  - herald-pack is capability-agnostic infra (no ousia deps) — buildable now,
    independent of the ousia fleet. Good early pick.
  - herald-conscience is build_target: mixed (SKILL.md + shell, not a new crate);
    build_into ~/wintermute/herald-conscience. It's the FIRST real input to
    herald-pack — validate them together (AC-5 on both sides).
  - conscience CI may stub ousia-guard with a recorded fixture, but the wire
    contract (args + --format json shape) must match the real binary.
Open questions (in vision doc): build-from-source vs release-fetch in install.sh
  (starting build-from-source); a herald-attest signing/provenance PRD deferred
  (needs jsy signing-key decision); marketplace repo home (leaning new public
  j0yen/wintermute-skills); skill name /conscience vs /ethics vs /ousia (working
  name /conscience).

## 2026-06-08T05:55  /dream  vision-lattice  (6 PRDs — federation/infinite-context capstone)
Seed (jsy, interactive): "make this skill infinitely wise … tools to automatically
  bridge ontologies. Give AIs infinite context. give them tools to find, join,
  traverse and deeply understand the world around them."
Third vision in tonight's arc: ousia (reason) → herald (distribute) → lattice
  (federate). Makes the ousia ethics skill "infinitely wise" by connecting it to
  the whole BFO ecosystem.
Grounded HARD in the paper:
  - §9.2 (line 467): "Because the World Ontology is BFO-grounded, it is
    interoperable with the over 500 existing BFO-conformant ontologies… can serve
    as a BRIDGE ontology." §8.2 (line 422) same. The seed is the paper's own §9.2.
  - Registries named + real: OBO Foundry (500+), CCO (DoD), FIBO, Gene/Disease Ont.
  - KEY tractability claim (honest): shared BFO upper layer (35 categories) prunes
    the cross-ontology mapping search space — that's why auto-bridging is feasible
    where generic ontology matching (OAEI) is hard. Not magic; BFO-anchored.
  - recall exists = EPISODIC memory (BGE+FTS5). lattice-context = STRUCTURED
    ontological retrieval. Complementary, kept SEPARATE (not duplicated).
  - "Infinite context" stated honestly = externalized federated graph + on-demand
    subgraph retrieval; bounded by the lattice not the window. NOT literal infinity.
Drafted: PRD-lattice-registry (find), -bridge (bridge — the core), -join (join),
  -traverse (traverse), -context (∞ context, MCP), -ground (deeply understand).
Vision: visions/lattice.md
Order: STRICT pipeline registry → bridge → join → traverse → context → ground.
  Maps 1:1 to the seed's verbs.
Notes for /build:
  - lattice-registry is the ONLY standalone piece (a fetcher/cataloger, no ousia
    dep) — buildable now. Everything else chains on it + the ousia fleet libs
    (reason/sparql). Do NOT start bridge/join/traverse before ousia-reason+sparql
    libs exist.
  - HARD RULE baked into ACs: NO silent auto-merge of low-confidence bridges.
    bridge emits confidence+evidence; low ones go to a review proposals file
    (recall-observe / skill-doctor pattern); join REFUSES unreviewed bridges
    unless --allow-unreviewed. Reviewer-gated, same as the rest of the fleet.
  - lattice-ground closes the loop back to herald-conscience: plain-language
    action → grounded classes → ousia-guard. Output shape is contract-tested
    against ousia-guard's input.
Open questions (vision doc): alignment false-positives (mitigated by review gate);
  external-ontology licensing (FIBO/CCO terms — registry records license, OBO
  open set first); whether "infinite" stays bounded/fast at scale (deferred
  lattice-scale PRD until join/traverse expose real numbers); recall vs
  lattice-context unification (kept separate for now).

## 2026-06-08T06:30  /dream  vision-tribunal  (4 PRDs — the proof layer for the outward arc)
Seed: bare /dream (interactive). Inward space saturated (3 prior "saturation
  scan — no PRDs" ticks); productive frontier is the outward arc seeded this
  morning. Found its un-dreamt THIRD leg: ousia *reasons*, herald *distributes*,
  but NOTHING proves the reasoner is right before /conscience ships outward.
Why real:
  - herald end-state #4 DEMANDS "an 'ethics skill' isn't shipped broken or
    unverifiable" — but herald-pack/market/conscience ship only structural
    skill-doctor/skill-manifest checks. No verdict-correctness check exists.
  - The tautology already cost this laptop: wm-router safety 100%→73.5% on a
    held-out set (feedback_agent_written_fixtures_tautology). Per hard-rule-1,
    /build→/autobuilder writes code AND its tests in one cycle → ousia-guard
    would grade its own homework. An ETHICS engine is the worst place for that.
  - ousia vision EXPLICITLY deferred ousia-conformance "to a later /dream pass."
    This is that pass (rehomed as tribunal-conformance — judge lives OUTSIDE the
    defendant: new workspace ~/wintermute/tribunal, not inside ousia).
Drafted: PRD-tribunal-conformance, PRD-tribunal-corpus, PRD-tribunal-bench,
  PRD-tribunal-gate.
Vision: visions/tribunal.md
Order: (conformance ∥ corpus) → bench → gate.
Notes for /build:
  - All four build NOW against fixtures/stubs — they do NOT block or delay ousia/
    herald. conformance vs a vendored fixture .owl; corpus is data + validator;
    bench vs a recorded guard-stub with the wire contract ASSERTED; gate via
    --dry-run + documented herald hook.
  - CROSS-VISION deps (ousia + herald both freshly drafted, UNBUILT):
    bench consumes ousia-guard's `check --action --format json --explain`
    contract; conformance consumes ousia-forge's .owl; gate consumes
    herald-pack's publish flow. Stub/fixture now; real wire-in at each
    consumer's AC. Don't wait on ousia/herald to start tribunal.
  - THE GATE IS THE POINT: enforce `tribunal gate` at herald-conscience's
    PUBLISH AC — false-allow==0 is hard/non-overridable; that is the AC that
    makes herald end-state #4 true with a mechanism, not a promise.
  - rust-cli ×3 + mixed ×1, all build_into ~/wintermute/tribunal (one workspace,
    one crate, four subcommands: conformance/corpus/bench/gate). SIGPIPE reset
    per self_sigpipe_panic_toolkit. rustc 1.85, no let-chains.
Open questions (in vision doc): corpus independence can't be FULLY proven
  mechanically (validator checks provenance tags; jsy human spot-check of the
  first cut is a release AC — is that acceptable?); accuracy threshold start
  (drafted ≥0.85, ratchets); v1 corpus size (~60, ≥2/tenet × {allow,flag,deny}).

## 2026-06-08T07:00  /dream  vision-recourse  (5 PRDs — the outward arc's return path)
Seed: bare /dream (interactive). Inward space saturated (3 prior saturation
  scans). The outward arc (ousia→tribunal→herald→lattice) is the live frontier,
  but it is WRITE-ONLY: ousia reasons, tribunal proves (vs jsy's static corpus),
  herald ships /conscience to strangers' machines — and NOTHING comes back. No
  receipt of what was decided, no way to contest a wrong verdict, no path for the
  field's disagreement to reach the axioms. This pass dreams that return path.
Why real:
  - herald end-state ships /conscience to a j0yen marketplace; verdicts then happen
    off-laptop with zero telemetry back. No PRD in any arc vision defines a
    receipt/contest/feedback channel.
  - tribunal proves correctness PRE-ship vs a FINITE jsy-authored corpus. Open-world
    assumption (509 classes) guarantees the field hits uncovered cases. The world is
    the ultimate held-out set; its answers never reach the answer key.
  - THE HINGE: a field contest's provenance.author is a downstream HUMAN ⇒
    != "ousia-axioms" ⇒ a contested case MECHANICALLY satisfies tribunal-corpus's
    independence guarantee. A field contest is the most honest held-out case there
    is — the axioms' authors provably could not have written it. Closes the loop
    that feedback_agent_written_fixtures_tautology (wm-router 100%→73.5%) warns about.
Drafted: PRD-recourse-receipt, PRD-recourse-contest, PRD-recourse-amend,
  PRD-recourse-pulse, PRD-recourse-feedback.
Vision: visions/recourse.md
Order: receipt → {contest → amend, pulse} → feedback.
Notes for /build:
  - recourse-receipt is the ONLY standalone piece — buildable NOW against a
    checked-in verdict JSON Schema + a recorded guard-stub (tribunal-bench's fixture
    approach). Everything else keys on its receipt.v1 format. Do NOT wait on ousia.
  - All five build_into ONE workspace ~/wintermute/recourse (one crate, subcommands
    receipt/contest/amend/pulse/feedback). rust-cli ×3 + mixed ×2.
  - CROSS-VISION deps (stub now, wire at AC; do NOT block tribunal/herald):
    amend consumes tribunal-corpus's action.json/expected.toml/provenance.toml shape
    + shells to `tribunal corpus validate`/`tribunal gate`; feedback shells to
    `tribunal gate` + `herald-market` publish. Recorded stubs with the wire contract
    ASSERTED, same pattern as tribunal-bench vs the guard-stub.
  - HARD RULES baked into ACs (the fleet's settled safety stance):
    * contest is a PROPOSAL — reviewer-gated pending.ndjson, NO auto-uphold, NO
      mutation of corpus/ontology (byte-identical-before/after AC).
    * amend enforces author=downstream:* (!= ousia-axioms) — the independence hinge.
    * pulse is AGGREGATE-ONLY + opt-in; --export is the ONLY data-egress path and
      carries no receipt_id/action_digest/per-action rows (grep AC). Never reads the
      raw actions/ store.
    * feedback NEVER auto-publishes; ship --confirm runs `tribunal gate` FIRST and a
      gate failure blocks the publish (false-ship==0, same spirit as tribunal-gate).
  - PII discipline: receipts store blake3(action), NEVER the action; raw action is
    local-only + opt-in (--store-raw). Marker-string-absence AC.
  - SIGPIPE reset per self_sigpipe_panic_toolkit; rustc 1.85, no let-chains.
Open questions (vision doc): receipt transport (drafted air-gapped-by-default,
  nothing phones home); contest identity granularity (opaque per-install id, no PII);
  third-party reviewer (local corpus fork vs --upstream propose to j0yen); amendment
  cadence vs ontology stability (batched version cuts, never per-contest).

## 2026-06-08T08:30  /dream  vision-mend  (4 PRDs — the remediation middle)
Seed: bare /dream (interactive). Inward + outward arcs saturated (recourse
  closed the outward return path at 07:00 today). Strongest unaddressed signal
  was the self-review's own chronic escalations — named/counted by `docket`,
  verified-when-fixed by `assay`, but REMEDIATED by nothing.
Why real (live docket this pass):
  - ctrace-sessionend-flake (warn) runs_seen:5 report_count:5 — OWNER-LESS.
    Hook ~/.claude/scripts/ctrace-session-end.sh silently skips render on a
    missing/stale marker (|| true swallows all); self-review backfills every run.
  - warden-enforcer-inert (warn) since 2026-06-03 — OWNER-LESS, carried+acked
    every run because nothing diagnoses WHY bpolicy reads loaded:false.
  - binstale: ~/wintermute/binstale is a COMPLETE built repo (5 src modules,
    verdict taxonomy) but NOT installed → `which binstale` fails → self-review
    prints "fleet staleness check skipped" every run, and it's not even docketed.
  - docket itself: agentns-session-zeros open 8 runs / 21-run precedent; counting
    survival never produced a fix. The escalation threshold is codified but
    eyeballed — nothing consumes it.
Drafted: PRD-mend-binstale-wire, PRD-mend-ctrace-render, PRD-mend-warden-doctor,
  PRD-mend-bridge.
Vision: visions/mend.md
Order: binstale-wire / ctrace-render / warden-doctor are independent leaf fixes
  (ship any order); bridge is independent of the leaves, needs only docket (built).
Notes for /build:
  - binstale-wire & warden-doctor are rust-extend into EXISTING repos
    (~/wintermute/binstale, ~/wintermute/bpolicy) — preserve existing modules.
  - ctrace-render is `mixed`: spans ~/wintermute/ctrace-scribe (render engine,
    add idempotent `render-session`) + the hook script. Backfill and exit-render
    must share ONE render code path.
  - bridge is a NEW rust-cli ~/wintermute/mend. PROPOSAL-ONLY (mirrors
    recourse-contest): never auto-builds, never `docket resolve`, never edits an
    existing PRD; bare `mend bridge` is dry-run. Reads the REAL docket interface
    (verified live: `docket list --escalated --format json`, record fields
    key/severity/title/runs_seen/consecutive_runs/report_count/evidence).
  - All four wire to docket via a `--format docket` emit that pipes to
    `docket report …`. Each fix's success signal is the finding stopping firing
    so `docket sweep` can auto-close it (the assay discipline).
  - SIGPIPE reset per self_sigpipe_panic_toolkit on all (they pipe to head/sh).
    rustc 1.85, no let-chains.
Open questions (vision doc): finding↔PRD linkage (naming convention
  PRD-mend-<key>.md vs a docket `prd:` annotation); warden-doctor strictly
  read-only vs a future gated --arm; binstale fleet curated-list vs --all;
  bridge same-tick-in-self-review vs own timer (safe same-tick since it only
  acts on --escalated, already past threshold).

## 2026-06-08T??:??  /dream  vision-muster  (4 PRDs — the live session roster)
Seed: bare /dream (interactive). Inward/outward arcs saturated; agentns fix
  already covered by [[assay]] (PRD-agentns-clone-flag-fix correctly diagnoses
  the 0x100==CLONE_VM collision + prctl re-route). Strongest UNCOVERED signal:
  self-review keeps flagging "duplicate Claude sessions ... may both be real"
  (2026-06-06 & -07 journals, both under Pending) and declines to act because
  the playbook is `pgrep -af claude` + "note duplicates, do not kill"
  (self-review/SKILL.md:70) with no origin attribution.
Why real (captured LIVE this run): 3 concurrent claude procs at dream time --
  pid 33958 interactive (tty parent 4279), 402723 `claude -p /self-review`,
  402724 `claude -p /dream` (this session). self-review and dream were running
  at once, each about to report the OTHER as a "duplicate." The process tree
  already encodes the answer (ppid chain = launcher, argv = role, cgroup = unit,
  claude-<pid>-jsy = bus peer) -- nothing reads it. session-index/postmortem/
  trace-receipt all key on transcript-log session-ids (post-hoc), NOT the live
  process population; agorabus peers = bus side; pevent = supervised jobs;
  ctrace-orphan-reap = bpftrace tracers. The roster itself is missing.
Drafted: PRD-muster-census, PRD-muster-verdict, PRD-muster-reap,
  PRD-muster-selfreview-bridge.
Vision: visions/muster.md
Order: census -> verdict -> {reap, selfreview-bridge}.
Notes for /build:
  - muster-census is a NEW rust-cli at ~/wintermute/muster (cargo-install to
    ~/.cargo/bin). SIGPIPE reset first line of main (pipes to head/jq, per
    self_sigpipe_panic_toolkit). rustc 1.85, no let-chains.
  - verdict & reap are rust-extend INTO ~/wintermute/muster -- preserve census
    modules, add classifier/reaper modules. selfreview-bridge is `mixed` (a
    --format selfreview emit + the self-review SKILL edit).
  - muster-reap is PROPOSAL-ONLY, mirrors recourse-contest / mend-bridge: dry-run
    default, HARD refusal to ever target interactive/live/duplicate (only
    orphan/stale eligible), --confirm required, SIGTERM-first, root-only signal.
    Never auto-invoked (no timer).
  - selfreview-bridge edits self-review/SKILL.md ~line 70 (swap pgrep step for
    `muster verdict --format selfreview`) with a pgrep fallback if muster absent
    -- coordinate so it doesn't fight a concurrent self-review edit.
  - agentns linkage: census reads /proc/<pid>/agent_session but it's all-zero
    today (agentns-session-zeros, see assay). Census records agent_session:null
    and uses the ppid/argv/cgroup heuristic; written so the kernel id becomes
    PREFERRED additively once PRD-agentns-clone-flag-fix lands. Soft dep on assay,
    not a blocker.
Open questions (vision doc): duplicate key = cwd vs project-slug (leaning slug);
  grace-window / stale-budget thresholds (derive from each role's tick budget,
  not magic constants); reap subtree (report all, signal root only).

## 2026-06-08T08:00  /dream  vision-tide  (4 PRDs — the reboot crossing)
Seed: bare /dream (interactive, no steer). Inward/outward arcs saturated (~48
  visions). Strongest UNCOVERED recurring signal: the pacman update queue that
  self-review reports as "BLOCKED — needs a reboot window" run after run after
  run (2026-06-06/-07/-08 journals, all under "Pending your call") and never
  acts on. Queue grew 29→101 in two days. mend.md:51 explicitly tags
  pacman-kernel-update-blocked as "user-gated reboot, NOT buildable" — and
  that's the gap: the reboot is human-gated, but EVERYTHING around it
  (enumerate / what-would-restart-fix / pick-window / verify-fleet-returned) is
  buildable and entirely untooled. Verified live: checkupdates, needrestart,
  reflector all ABSENT (command -v → nothing). Kernel skew live: booted
  7.0.10-wintermute · linux pkg 7.0.9 · queue wants 7.0.11 — rendered nowhere.
Why distinct from quicken: quicken attests KERNEL-PRIMITIVE liveness (memlog/
  agentns/bpolicy/provfs, "built but never came alive"); it only mentions
  `pacman -U pkgrel-11 + reboot` as one memlog remedy string. tide owns the OS
  UPDATE→REBOOT→VERIFY lifecycle for the whole system — different altitude.
Drafted: PRD-tide-survey, PRD-tide-restart, PRD-tide-window, PRD-tide-landfall.
Vision: visions/tide.md
Order: survey → { restart, window } → landfall.
Notes for /build:
  - tide-survey is a NEW rust-cli at ~/wintermute/tide (cargo-install to
    ~/.cargo/bin). MUST ship FIRST — creates repo + binary + core types
    (UpdateState/Verdict/RebootClass/KernelSkew) + the read-only pacman reader.
    Do NOT start any rust-extend until ~/wintermute/tide exists or extend-
    validate fails (the relay/concord rule). SIGPIPE reset first line of main
    (pipes to head/jq, per self_sigpipe_panic_toolkit). rustc 1.85, no let-chains.
  - restart, window, landfall are all rust-extend INTO ~/wintermute/tide.
    restart ⟂ window (both extend survey, independent of each other). landfall
    consumes survey's expected-state (adds a `survey --record` flag — the only
    survey touch).
  - READ-ONLY / proposal-first throughout. tide NEVER reboots, NEVER runs
    `pacman -Su`/`systemctl reboot`. The reboot stays human-gated per mend.md:51.
    tide-window is proposal-only like muster-reap / recourse-contest / mend-bridge
    (no --apply/--confirm; --plan only PRINTS the command). AC5 on window asserts
    the binary contains no reboot/pacman-mutate invocation.
  - pacman read uses the checkupdates pattern: sync to a PRIVATE --dbpath under
    XDG_CACHE; NEVER touches /var/lib/pacman. Fallback to `pacman -Qu` with
    stale:true. All parsers fixture-driven + offline in cargo test (no live
    pacman -Sy in tests) → cloud-build-safe.
Soft deps (additive, not blockers):
  - tide-window's "active sessions" input = muster census output; window parses
    `muster census --format json` if present, else pgrep fallback. Coordinate so
    window doesn't re-implement the roster muster owns.
  - tide-landfall's watchman-roots check VERIFIES anchor's reconcile (reports an
    unwatched root); it does NOT re-watch — keep the reconcile in anchor.
Open questions (vision doc): checkupdates-without-checkupdates (private-dbpath
  read acceptable, or parse `pacman -Sup` only?); landfall trigger (boot-time
  systemd-user oneshot vs SessionStart hook vs both, deduped by boot-id) — left
  as a deferred `mixed` config follow-on, not baked into the rust-extend.
